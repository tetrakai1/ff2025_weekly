## Critical Lineup Decisions

### Decision 1: Rashee Rice Returns from Suspension

**Rashee Rice (17.2 proj) vs WSH:**
- **Suspension ended** after Week 6 (6-game ban for personal conduct violation)
- **Week 7 return:** 7 receptions on 10 targets, 42 yards, **2 TDs**
- Led Chiefs in targets and receptions in first game back
- Patrick Mahomes' favorite pass catcher is BACK

**Multi-Source Analysis:**
- ESPN Projection: 17.2 pts
- FantasyPros: Top-12 WR this week
- Expert Consensus: Must-start after dominant Week 7 return

**DECISION: START with HIGH confidence**
**Rationale:** Rice immediately reclaimed his WR1 role. Double-digit targets in return game = elite floor and ceiling.

---

### Decision 2: FLEX - Tetairoa McMillan vs Tyjae Spears

**Tetairoa McMillan (WR, CAR) - 13.4 proj @ BUF:**
- **Expert Upgrade:** Ranked WR17 in Week 8 PPR (top-12 consideration)
- **Matchup:** Bills tough defense (#7 vs WR), but Panthers may throw heavily if trailing
- **Volume:** 2nd on team in targets Week 7 (5 targets)
- **PPR Advantage:** Full PPR league favors WR over RB in flex

**Tyjae Spears (RB, TEN) - 8.9 proj vs IND:**
- **Tough Matchup:** Colts rank #6 vs RB (90.3 yards/game allowed)
- **Volume Concern:** Tony Pollard primary back (24 touches vs 17 for Spears last 2 weeks)
- **Defensive Strength:** No RB has rushed for 100+ yards vs IND this season

**DECISION: Start Tetairoa McMillan in FLEX**
**Rationale:**
- 4.5 point projection advantage
- Experts upgraded McMillan to WR1 status this week
- PPR format favors reception volume
- Spears faces elite run defense with limited TD upside

---

### Decision 3: TE - Evan Engram vs Cade Otton

**Both project 9.9 points - true coin flip decision.**

**Evan Engram (DEN) vs DAL:**
- Consistent target share in Denver offense
- Matchup: Cowboys rank #17 vs TE (neutral)
- Higher floor, proven veteran

**Cade Otton (TB) @ NO:**
- Matchup: Saints rank middle-of-pack vs TE
- Upside: Could see more targets with WRs potentially limited

**DECISION: Start Evan Engram (slight edge)**
**Rationale:** When projections are identical, go with the more consistent veteran option. Engram has been reliable all season.

## Defense/Special Teams Deep Dive

### Falcons D/ST vs Miami - Elite Streaming Play

**Expert Rankings:** #3 defense for Week 8 (Pro Football Network, Roto Street Journal)

**Why Atlanta is a TOP-3 Play:**

**Miami's Offensive Collapse:**
- Surrendering **7th-most fantasy points to opposing defenses**
- Scored only 6 points Week 7 with **3 turnovers** vs Cleveland
- Tua Tagovailoa: **6 INTs in last 2 games**
- O-line allowed multiple sacks in **5 of 7 games**
- Dolphins have "graduated from falling apart to flat-out broken"

**Atlanta's Defensive Dominance:**
- Ranked **#2 in total defense**, **#1 in pass defense**
- Allowing only 20 points per game (#8 in scoring defense)
- Top 10 in pressure rate (Tua struggles under pressure)
- **#1 vs pass**, **#2 in yards allowed per game**

**Game Script:** Falcons favored at home, Miami offense dysfunctional

**Projected:** 6.7 pts (conservative - could easily hit 8-10 with sacks/turnovers)

**Available Alternatives:**
- Chargers D/ST: 6.1 proj (inferior matchup)
- 49ers D/ST: 5.3 proj
- Jets D/ST: 5.9 proj

**DECISION: Keep Falcons D/ST - do not stream**
**Rationale:** You already own the #3 ranked defense for Week 8. No need to make a move.

## Waiver Wire Recommendations

### Priority 1: Tyler Allgeier (RB, ATL) - BYE WEEK DEPTH

**Why Add:**
- **Available:** Confirmed on waiver wire (7.3 projection)
- **Elite Matchup:** vs Miami (allows **2nd-most fantasy points to RBs**)
- **Recent Success:** Browns' Judkins scored 3 TDs vs Miami Week 7
- **Volume:** Falcons lead NFL in rushing attempts per game (31.8)
- **Game Script:** Falcons likely leading = rushing volume in 2nd half

**Multi-Source Analysis:**
- ESPN Projection: 7.3 pts
- Expert Consensus: RB3/Flex start this week
- Miami allows 170 rushing yards/game over last 4 weeks
- In Falcons' 3 wins (positive game script), Allgeier hit double-digits each time

**Usage Scenario:**
- **Week 8:** Flex/RB3 option if needed (Bucky Irving still OUT)
- **Future Bye Weeks:** RB depth insurance
- **Weeks 10-14:** Potential flex plays in favorable matchups

**Who to Drop:** Justin Fields (see analysis below)

---

### Priority 2: Consider Dropping Justin Fields

**Case FOR Keeping Fields:**
- Week 10 bye coverage for Jordan Love (NON-NEGOTIABLE need)
- Playoff insurance (Weeks 16-17 if Love injured)

**Case AGAINST Keeping Fields:**
- 0.9 projection this week (extremely low)
- Garrett Wilson OUT multiple weeks (hyperextended knee) - diminishes upside
- Extremely volatile: 5 games ranging from 4.2 to 26.8 points
- Expert consensus: "Nearly impossible to trade" in 1-QB leagues
- 10+ QBs typically available on waivers for streaming

**Alternative Week 10 Options (if you drop Fields):**
- Joe Burrow (available) - 0.0 proj Week 8 (likely on bye or injured, check status)
- Michael Penix Jr. (available via weekly report)
- Tua Tagovailoa (available)
- **Risk:** These may be rostered by Week 10

**RECOMMENDATION: HOLD Justin Fields for now**
**Rationale:** Week 10 is only 2 weeks away. Don't risk being unable to stream a QB. Dropping Fields for Allgeier adds minimal value this week (you already have a solid starting lineup). Revisit after Week 10 bye.

**Alternative Drop Candidate:** None ideal - your bench is tight with bye weeks.

---

### Other Available Options (Monitor, Don't Add Yet)

**RBs:**
- Kareem Hunt (7.0 proj) - **AVOID:** Ankle injury Week 7, droppable per experts
- Tyrone Tracy Jr. (5.3 proj) - Low volume backup
- Joe Mixon (0.0 proj) - **AVOID:** OUT FOR SEASON (foot injury)

**WRs:**
- Elic Ayomanor (9.0 proj) - Great matchup vs IND, but you have WR depth
- Jayden Higgins (9.1 proj) - Deep league option
- Hollywood Brown (6.6 proj) - Already evaluated and dropped Week 7

**D/ST:**
- Rams D/ST - ON BYE (unavailable)

**Verdict:** No urgent waiver moves needed beyond monitoring Tyler Allgeier.
