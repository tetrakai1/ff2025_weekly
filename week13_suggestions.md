## Thursday Game Results (Projected vs Actual)

**Thanksgiving games are complete.** Here's how our players performed vs projections:

| Player | Position | Matchup | ESPN Proj | LLM Proj | Actual | Diff (vs LLM) |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Rashee Rice | WR (START) | @ DAL | 18.1 | 20.2 | **29.4** | +9.2 |
| Emanuel Wilson | RB (START) | @ DET | 5.3 | 4.5 | **0.0** | -4.5 |
| Jordan Love | QB (BENCH) | @ DET | 15.7 | 15.7 | **27.1** | +11.4 |
| Jameson Williams | WR (BENCH) | vs GB | 11.8 | 10.8 | **5.6** | -5.2 |

**Thursday Totals:**
- **Your Thursday Points:** 29.4 (Rice started, Wilson started)
- **Opponent Thursday Points:** 15.6 (Gibbs was held to 68 yards)

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Rashee Rice CRUSHED IT** - 8 receptions, 92 yards, 2 TDs in elite Cowboys matchup. LLM projection was +9 points too conservative.
2. **Emanuel Wilson BUST** - 0.0 fantasy points as Jacobs returned to lead role. LLM correctly identified reduced role but 0.0 was worst-case scenario.
3. **Jordan Love BOOM (Benched)** - 4 TD passes in 31-24 upset win over Lions. Benching was wrong call in hindsight.
4. **Game Script:** Packers upset Lions 31-24 - positive game script for GB players

**Lesson Learned:** Love's Week 12 bust (7.1 pts) was matchup-specific, not a trend. The Lions pass funnel defense allowed big games.

## Matchup Overview (Updated Post-Thursday)

**Opponent:** 4th and pinches (8-4, #2 in league)

### Current Score (Thursday Complete)
| Team | Thursday Pts | Sunday Projected | Total |
|------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **Valued Customers** | 29.4 | ~99 pts remaining | **~128 pts** |
| **4th and pinches** | 15.6 | ~94 pts remaining | **~109 pts** |

**Current Lead: +13.8 pts**

**Updated Win Probability:** ~72% (improved from 69% due to Thursday advantage)

**Opponent's Top Threats (Sunday):**
- Trey McBride (TE): Top-tier TE with heavy target volume
- DK Metcalf (WR): QUESTIONABLE - potential bench substitution

**Key Opponent Update:**
- Jahmyr Gibbs was CONTAINED: 68 yards on 20 carries vs Packers D
- Opponent's Thursday players underperformed expectations

**Analysis:** We gained a +13.8 point advantage on Thursday. Rice's explosion offset Wilson's bust. Opponent's Gibbs was held in check by Green Bay's defense.

---

## CRITICAL INJURY ALERTS (Updated Nov 28)

### Thursday Game Updates
**Josh Jacobs (GB) DOMINATED** - Played Thursday, returned to full lead-back role. Emanuel Wilson was completely phased out (0.0 fantasy points).

**Jordan Love (GB) EXPLODED** - 4 TD passes in upset win over Lions. Benching him was incorrect in hindsight.

### Sunday Injury Updates

**RETURNING - Bucky Irving (TB) vs ARI, Sunday 1:00 PM:**
- **Status:** Full practice Wednesday - EXPECTED TO PLAY
- **Snap count:** Coach Bowles expects ~36% snap share (similar to Godwin's return last week)
- **Touch expectations:** "Touches matter more than snaps" - could touch ball on 50% of his snaps
- **Role:** Committee with Sean Tucker (goal-line) and Rachaad White
- **LLM Projection:** 18.0 pts (MEDIUM confidence) - high ceiling even on limited snaps vs weak Cardinals run D

**ACTIVATION WATCH - Omarion Hampton (LAC) vs LV, Sunday 4:25 PM:**
- **Status:** LIMITED practice Wed/Thu (ankle) - EXPECTED TO BE ACTIVATED SATURDAY
- **21-day window:** Opened November 25, must be activated by December 16
- **Role:** OC Greg Roman plans "1-2 punch" committee with Kimani Vidal
- **Hampton quote:** "Feel amazing, hope to be full go once activated"
- **LLM Projection:** 9.0 pts (MEDIUM confidence) - committee reduces ceiling but RB1 talent
- **Decision:** If activated Saturday, consider over Tyjae Spears as backup option

**QUESTIONABLE - Marvin Harrison Jr. (ARI) vs TB:**
- **Status:** Returned to practice after appendicitis surgery (Nov 10)
- **ESPN BUG:** Still projecting 13.7 pts despite QUESTIONABLE status
- **LLM Projection:** 9.4 pts if active, 0.0 if out
- **Recommendation:** Monitor Saturday injury report - DO NOT START unless cleared for full snaps

## Recommended Starting Lineup (Updated Post-Thursday)

| Position | Player | Team | Opponent | Time | ESPN Proj | LLM Proj | Actual | Status |
|----------|--------|------|----------|------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| **QB** | Jacoby Brissett | ARI | @ TB | Sun 1:00 PM | 17.3 | 17.9 | -- | PENDING |
| **RB** | Bucky Irving | TB | vs ARI | Sun 1:00 PM | 11.8 | 18.0 | -- | PENDING |
| **RB** | Emanuel Wilson | GB | @ DET | Thu 12:30 PM | 5.3 | 4.5 | **0.0** | LOCKED |
| **WR** | Jaxon Smith-Njigba | SEA | vs MIN | Sun 4:05 PM | 21.9 | 23.2 | -- | PENDING |
| **WR** | Rashee Rice | KC | @ DAL | Thu 4:30 PM | 18.1 | 20.2 | **29.4** | LOCKED |
| **TE** | Juwan Johnson | NO | @ MIA | Sun 1:00 PM | 8.7 | 10.8 | -- | PENDING |
| **FLEX** | Tetairoa McMillan | CAR | @ LAR | Sun 4:25 PM | 13.2 | 13.7 | -- | PENDING |
| **K** | Jason Myers | SEA | vs MIN | Sun 4:05 PM | 8.5 | 10.9 | -- | PENDING |
| **D/ST** | Rams D/ST | LAR | vs CAR | Sun 4:25 PM | 7.5 | 8.8 | -- | PENDING |

**Thursday Points Locked In:** 29.4 pts (Rice 29.4 + Wilson 0.0)
**Sunday Projected Points:** ~98.7 pts (LLM)
**Total Projected Points:** ~128.1 pts

**Wilson Analysis:** Unfortunately Wilson busted with 0.0 pts as Jacobs dominated. In hindsight, waiting for Hampton would have been better. However, Rice's 29.4 pt explosion more than compensated.

## Full Bench Listing (Updated Post-Thursday)

| Position | Player | Team | Status | ESPN Proj | LLM Proj | Actual | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| QB | Jordan Love | GB | LOCKED | 15.7 | 15.7 | **27.1** | 4 TDs! Benching was WRONG - exploded vs Lions |
| RB | Omarion Hampton | LAC | QUEST | 12.3 | 9.0 | -- | Expected activation Saturday - committee with Vidal |
| RB | Tyjae Spears | TEN | BENCH | 9.9 | 8.4 | -- | Committee with Pollard - backup if Hampton not activated |
| WR | Marvin Harrison Jr. | ARI | QUEST | 13.7 | 9.4 | -- | ESPN BUG - First practice since surgery, monitor |
| WR | Keenan Allen | LAC | BENCH | 12.0 | 12.7 | -- | WR36 - declining target share, borderline flex |
| WR | Jameson Williams | DET | LOCKED | 11.8 | 10.8 | **5.6** | Underperformed vs GB - volatile as expected |
| TE | Evan Engram | DEN | BENCH | 8.1 | 6.5 | -- | Declining role - Johnson clearly better |

**Bench Thursday Points (not in lineup):** Jordan Love 27.1, Jameson Williams 5.6 = 32.7 pts
**Opportunity Cost:** Love's 27.1 pts vs Brissett's projected 17.9 = ~9 pts left on bench

---

## Position-by-Position Analysis

### QUARTERBACK: Jacoby Brissett vs Jordan Love

#### Jacoby Brissett (ARI @ TB, AWAY, Sunday 1:00 PM)
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 17.3 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Sonnet 4.5):** 17.9 pts (HIGH confidence)
- **Recommendation:** **START** - Consistent QB1 production, favorable matchup

**LLM Reasoning:**
- **Defensive matchup:** Buccaneers secondary has been torched repeatedly - allowing most fantasy PPG to QBs over past 3 weeks
- **Recent form:** Attempted 44+ passes in 4 of 6 starts, scored 18+ fantasy pts in ALL of them
- **Pass volume:** Set NFL record with 47 completions vs 49ers (Week 11) - elite passing game
- **Expert consensus:** SI.com ranks him as QB9 for Week 13, "strong QB1 week firmly in play"
- **Historical bias:** QBs systematically under-projected by ESPN by -2.00 pts (R²=0.169)

**Data Sources Used:** vegas, defense, recent_performance, experts, bias_analysis

---

#### Jordan Love (GB @ DET, AWAY, Thursday 12:30 PM)
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 15.7 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Sonnet 4.5):** 15.7 pts (MEDIUM confidence)
- **Recommendation:** **BENCH** - Worst fantasy finish of the year last week (7.1 pts)

**LLM Reasoning:**
- **Recent disaster:** 7.1 fantasy pts vs Vikings (Week 12) - worst performance of season
- **Passing struggles:** Hasn't surpassed 200 passing yards in last 3 games
- **Defensive matchup:** Lions rank 15th vs pass (210.5 yards allowed) - middle of pack

**Data Sources Used:** vegas, defense, recent_performance, experts

**DECISION: START JACOBY BRISSETT** - Consistent floor (18+ in all 6 starts) vs Love's bust potential.

---

### RUNNING BACK #1: Bucky Irving (TB vs ARI, HOME, Sunday 1:00 PM)
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 11.8 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Sonnet 4.5):** 18.0 pts (MEDIUM confidence)
- **Recommendation:** **START** - Returning from injury with favorable matchup

**LLM Reasoning:**
- **Injury status:** Full practice Wednesday - cleared to play. Coach Bowles expects pitch count (~36% snaps)
- **Matchup:** Cardinals rank 17th vs run (114.2 YPG allowed), 22nd in fantasy PPG to RBs
- **Upside:** High ceiling (boom-or-bust) but even limited snaps could produce vs weak run D

**Data Sources Used:** injury_reports, defense, recent_performance, experts, vegas

---

### RUNNING BACK #2: Emanuel Wilson (GB @ DET, AWAY, Thursday 12:30 PM)
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 5.3 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Sonnet 4.5):** 4.5 pts (LOW confidence)
- **Recommendation:** **START** (user preference) - See detailed RB2 analysis below

**CRITICAL UPDATE:** Josh Jacobs confirmed to play Thursday. Wilson returns to BACKUP role.

**LLM Reasoning:**
- **Role change:** Wilson was RB1 last week (Jacobs OUT) - now BACKUP (Jacobs playing)
- **Week 12 context:** 26.5 pts was with Jacobs OUT - that role no longer exists
- **Matchup:** Lions have strong run defense, haven't allowed 100-yard rusher in 2025
- **Ceiling:** Reduced from 15+ pts to 6-8 pts max in backup role

**Data Sources Used:** vegas, defense, injury_reports, bias_analysis

---

### RB2 DECISION ANALYSIS: Post-Mortem

**The Decision (Thursday):** User chose to start Emanuel Wilson over waiting for Hampton news.

**RESULT: WILSON BUSTED (0.0 pts)**

| Factor | Pre-Game Expectation | Actual Result |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Wilson Projection** | 4.5 pts (LLM) | **0.0 pts** |
| **Role** | Backup to Jacobs | **Completely phased out** |
| **Touches** | 5-8 expected | **Minimal** |
| **Game Script** | Packers upset Lions 31-24 | Love threw 4 TDs, no need for Wilson |

**What Happened:**
- Josh Jacobs dominated as expected
- Packers built early lead via passing (Love 4 TDs)
- Wilson saw minimal touches with positive game script favoring starters
- Worst-case scenario materialized

**LLM Was Right:** The recommendation to wait for Hampton would have been better. However:
- Rashee Rice's 29.4 pts more than compensated for Wilson's bust
- Net Thursday performance: 29.4 pts (still strong)
- Hampton activation still pending for Sunday

---

### REMAINING RB DECISION: Hampton vs Spears (Sunday)

Since Wilson busted, the RB2 slot is now locked at 0.0 pts. For future reference:

**Omarion Hampton (if activated Saturday):**
- **Expected:** LIMITED practice Wed/Thu, activation Saturday afternoon
- **LLM Projection:** 9.0 pts (committee with Vidal)
- **Ceiling:** 15+ pts with RB1 talent
- **Recommendation:** START if activated

**Tyjae Spears (backup option):**
- **LLM Projection:** 8.4 pts (committee with Pollard)
- **Recommendation:** Only start if Hampton not activated

**Monitor Saturday injury reports for Hampton activation news.**

---

### WIDE RECEIVER #1: Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA vs MIN, HOME, Sunday 4:05 PM)
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 21.9 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Sonnet 4.5):** 23.2 pts (HIGH confidence)
- **Recommendation:** **START** - Must-start WR1, NFL's leading receiver

**LLM Reasoning:**
- **Historic season:** 1,313 receiving yards in 11 games - BROKE DK Metcalf's Seahawks single-season record
- **Week 12 explosion:** 8-167-2 (37.1 fantasy pts) vs Titans
- **Consistency:** 100+ yards in 8 of 11 games, 90+ in 10 of 11 games - ELITE floor

**Data Sources Used:** vegas, weather, defense, recent_performance, experts

---

### WIDE RECEIVER #2: Rashee Rice (KC @ DAL, AWAY, Thursday 4:30 PM)
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 18.1 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Sonnet 4.5):** 20.2 pts (HIGH confidence)
- **Recommendation:** **START** - Elite matchup vs Cowboys' struggling secondary

**LLM Reasoning:**
- **Injury status:** OFF injury report - full practice Tuesday/Wednesday after limited Monday (hamstring)
- **Matchup:** Cowboys allow MOST fantasy PPG to WRs this season - ELITE opportunity
- **Recent form:** 8-141 vs Colts (Week 11), 4 TDs in 5 games since return from suspension
- **Vegas odds:** O/U 52 points - high-scoring Thanksgiving game expected

**Data Sources Used:** injury_reports, vegas, defense, recent_performance, experts

---

### TIGHT END: Juwan Johnson (NO @ MIA, AWAY, Sunday 1:00 PM)
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 8.7 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Sonnet 4.5):** 10.8 pts (MEDIUM confidence)
- **Recommendation:** **START** - Strong streaming option with Tyler Shough chemistry

**LLM Reasoning:**
- **Matchup:** Dolphins allow 4th-most fantasy PPG to TEs, 10+ pts to 7 TEs this season
- **Recent form:** Double-digit fantasy pts in 5 straight games (averaging 13 PPG with Shough)
- **Role:** Clear #2 passing option behind Chris Olave

**Data Sources Used:** defense, recent_performance, experts, injury_reports

---

### FLEX: Tetairoa McMillan (CAR @ LAR, AWAY, Sunday 4:25 PM)
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 13.2 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Sonnet 4.5):** 13.7 pts (MEDIUM confidence)
- **Recommendation:** **START** - Target volume + late game = FLEX positioning

**LLM Reasoning:**
- **Week 11 explosion:** 8-130-2 (33.0 fantasy pts) vs Falcons - showed elite upside
- **Role:** Leads Carolina in catches (54), receiving yards (748), TDs (4)
- **Game time:** 4:25 PM - LATEST Sunday game on roster (put in FLEX for flexibility)

**Data Sources Used:** defense, recent_performance, experts, game_script

---

### KICKER: Jason Myers (SEA vs MIN, HOME, Sunday 4:05 PM)
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 8.5 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Sonnet 4.5):** 10.9 pts (MEDIUM confidence)
- **Recommendation:** **START** - Seahawks high-scoring offense = FG opportunities

**LLM Reasoning:**
- **Recent form:** 9, 15, 14, 13 pts over last 4 weeks - averaging 12.8 PPG
- **Historical bias:** ESPN K projections RANDOM (R²=0.039) - ignore ESPN projection entirely

**Data Sources Used:** vegas, weather, recent_performance, bias_analysis

---

### DEFENSE: Rams D/ST (LAR vs CAR, HOME, Sunday 4:25 PM)
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 7.5 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Sonnet 4.5):** 8.8 pts (HIGH confidence)
- **Recommendation:** **START** - Elite defense vs struggling offense

**LLM Reasoning:**
- **Elite defense:** #1 in points allowed per game (16.3), top-3 D/ST play this week
- **Recent form:** 20 pts in Week 12 vs TB - dominating recent opponents
- **Matchup:** Panthers held under 17 pts in 5 of last 6 games

**Data Sources Used:** defense, recent_performance, experts, bias_analysis

## APPENDIX: ESPN Projection Accuracy Analysis

**Analysis Date:** November 27, 2025
**Weeks Analyzed:** 1-12 (197 player-week records)

---

### Overall ESPN Projection Accuracy (Weeks 1-12)

**Aggregate Statistics:**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 4.45 points
- **Mean Bias:** +0.08 points (ESPN nearly neutral)
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):** 6.01 points
- **R² Correlation:** 0.477 (moderate predictive power)

---

### Position-Specific Accuracy Analysis

| Position | Sample Size | MAE | Bias | RMSE | R² | Reliability |
|----------|-------------|-----|------|------|-----|-------------|
| **QB** | 16 | 6.20 | **-2.00** | 7.41 | **0.169** | VERY LOW |
| **RB** | 55 | 3.71 | +0.78 | 5.55 | **0.541** | HIGH |
| **WR** | 78 | 5.00 | +0.18 | 6.56 | 0.498 | MODERATE |
| **TE** | 24 | 3.57 | -0.56 | 4.66 | **0.231** | LOW |
| **K** | 12 | 3.29 | +0.24 | 3.92 | **0.039** | RANDOM |
| **D/ST** | 12 | 4.91 | +0.12 | 6.34 | 0.044 | RANDOM |

---

### Key Findings

**QBs:** ESPN under-projects by -2.00 pts on average - add 2 pts to ESPN projection
**RBs:** Most reliable position (R²=0.541) - trust ESPN base projections
**WRs:** Moderate reliability - use ESPN as starting point with context adjustments
**TEs:** Low correlation - use target volume and matchup instead
**K/D/ST:** Essentially random - use Vegas environment exclusively

---

### Team-Specific Bias: Your Opponent (4th and pinches)

From league-wide analysis:
- **4th and pinches QBs:** -2.69 pts bias (UNDERPERFORM projections)
- **4th and pinches RBs:** +0.70 pts bias (slightly beat projections)
- **4th and pinches WRs:** -1.56 pts bias (underperform)

**Implication:** Opponent's players may underperform ESPN projections.

## Conclusion (Updated Post-Thursday)

### Thursday Results Summary
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Your Thursday Pts** | 29.4 (Rice 29.4, Wilson 0.0) |
| **Opponent Thursday Pts** | 15.6 (Gibbs held to 68 yds) |
| **Thursday Advantage** | **+13.8 pts** |
| **Bench Pts Left** | 27.1 (Love), 5.6 (J. Williams) |

### What Worked
- **Rashee Rice ELITE** - 8/92/2 = 29.4 pts, exceeded 20.2 LLM projection by 9+ pts
- **Cowboys matchup as predicted** - Elite WR opportunity delivered
- **Opponent contained** - Gibbs held to 68 yards by Packers D

### What Didn't Work
- **Wilson BUST** - 0.0 pts, completely phased out with Jacobs back
- **Love BENCHED** - 27.1 pts on bench (4 TD passes), benching was wrong call
- **LLM underestimated Love** - Week 12 bust (7.1 pts) was anomaly, not trend

### Updated Sunday Strategy
1. **Jacoby Brissett at QB** - Already locked in, can't change. Projected 17.9 pts
2. **Bucky Irving at RB1** - Returning from injury on pitch count (~36% snaps), favorable matchup vs Cardinals
3. **RB2 slot LOCKED at 0.0** - Wilson already busted, can't change
4. **JSN must-start WR1** - 23.2 pts projected, NFL's leading receiver
5. **McMillan in FLEX** (4:25 PM) - Latest game for flexibility
6. **Rams D/ST** - Elite matchup vs Panthers

### Critical Sunday Actions
- **Saturday PM:** Monitor Hampton activation news
- **Sunday AM:** Check Bucky Irving snap count reports
- **Sunday AM:** Monitor Marvin Harrison Jr. status (if activated, consider for future weeks)

### Updated Projected Outcome
- **Your Total:** 29.4 (locked) + 98.7 (projected Sunday) = **~128 pts**
- **Opponent Total:** 15.6 (locked) + 94 (projected Sunday) = **~109 pts**
- **Expected WIN by ~19 pts**

**Updated Win Probability: ~72%** (improved from 69% due to Thursday advantage)
