## ðŸ“Š Position-by-Position Analysis

### QUARTERBACK

#### **STARTER: Jordan Love (GB)**
- **Projection:** 14.9 points
- **Analysis:** Solid QB2 facing Washington at home on Thursday Night Football. Clear skies and comfortable 70Â°F temperatures at Lambeau Field create ideal passing conditions. Washington allowed 24 points to Buffalo in Week 1. Love connected well with Matthew Golden for 15.9 fantasy points in Week 1.
- **Why over alternatives:** Limited waiver options with Cam Ward facing elite Denver defense. Love's home field advantage and good weather make him the safe play.

### RUNNING BACKS

#### **RB1: Bucky Irving (TB)** 
- **Projection:** 17.3 points
- **Analysis:** Elite RB1 play despite tough Houston matchup (11th-ranked run defense). His 4 catches in Week 1 demonstrate PPR value, crucial against a stout front-seven. With Tristan Wirfs out, expect more quick passes and screens to Irving. Monday Night Football provides extra prep time.
- **Verdict:** MUST START - Volume and pass-catching role ensure floor

#### **RB2: J.K. Dobbins (DEN)**
- **Projection:** 10.6 points  
- **Analysis:** Favorable matchup at Indianapolis in 81Â°F clear conditions. Colts allowed 150+ rushing yards to Bills in Week 1. Denver's strong offensive line and outdoor track conditions favor Dobbins' speed. Committee concerns persist but lead role seems secure after Week 1.
- **Verdict:** START WITH CONFIDENCE - Matchup outweighs committee risks

#### **Bench RBs:**
- **Cam Skattebo (NYG):** 8.1 proj - Hold for bye weeks
- **Tyler Allgeier (ATL):** 5.6 proj - Consider dropping for waiver additions

### WIDE RECEIVERS

#### **WR1: Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA)**
- **Projection:** 14.7 points
- **Analysis:** Absolute stud after 9 catches for 124 yards in Week 1. Now Seattle's unquestioned WR1 with DK traded and Lockett released. Pittsburgh allowed 144 yards to WRs in Week 1. His 13 targets Week 1 demonstrate elite volume. Clear 73Â°F conditions in Pittsburgh favor passing game.
- **Verdict:** LOCKED IN WR1 - Elite volume in PPR formats

#### **WR2: Marvin Harrison Jr. (ARI)**  
- **Projection:** 13.9 points
- **Analysis:** Home matchup against Carolina in scorching 95Â°F conditions. Connected with Kyler for 45-yard bomb and TD in Week 1, showing improved chemistry. Panthers defense struggled in Week 1. Cardinals -6.5 favorites suggests positive game script. Heat may limit defenses more than offenses.
- **Verdict:** START - Talent and matchup overcome 2024 concerns

#### **FLEX: Tetairoa McMillan (CAR)**
- **Projection:** 13.8 points
- **Analysis:** Road underdog but faces Arizona's suspect secondary. With Thielen gone, McMillan is the clear alpha receiver. The 95Â°F heat in Arizona could tire defenses. Bryce Young looked improved late in 2024. Garbage time potential as 6.5-point underdogs.
- **Verdict:** CONFIDENT FLEX - Volume and potential shootout

#### **Bench WRs:**
- **Darnell Mooney (ATL):** QUESTIONABLE - Practiced Wednesday but monitor injury
- **Matthew Golden (GB):** Thursday already played
- **Hollywood Brown (KC):** 10 catches Week 1 but unclear role
- **Keenan Allen (LAC):** Aging, consider for trade

### TIGHT END

#### **STARTER: Cade Otton (TB)**
- **Projection:** 7.5 points
- **Analysis:** With Evan Engram's calf injury (left Week 1 twice for medical tent), pivot to Otton. Tampa's TE1 facing Houston on Monday night. Connected with Baker for 6.8 points Week 1. Volume should increase if Evans draws shadow coverage from Derek Stingley Jr.
- **Alternative:** Monitor Engram's Thursday status - if active, he's still the play
- **Verdict:** START OTTON if Engram sits, otherwise stick with Engram

### KICKER

#### **STARTER: Jake Elliott (PHI)**
- **Projection:** 8.6 points
- **Analysis:** Monday Night Football at Kansas City. High-scoring environment (47-point total) favors kickers. Eagles' explosive offense ensures red zone trips. Dome conditions remove weather variables.
- **Verdict:** SET AND FORGET

### DEFENSE/ST

#### **STARTER: Cardinals D/ST**  
- **Projection:** 7.0 points
- **Analysis:** Home against struggling Panthers offense. 95Â°F heat advantages home team's conditioning. Bryce Young still developing. Added Josh Sweat and Calais Campbell in offseason. Carolina managed just 10 points in Week 1.
- **Verdict:** EXCELLENT STREAMING OPTION
