## Free Agent Priority Adds

### MUST ADD (Before Sunday)

**1. Rams D/ST (LAR) - HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- **Projection:** 6.7 points
- **Matchup:** vs Jaguars (London game, Sunday 9:30 AM ET)
- **Why Elite:** Jaguars allow 3rd-most fantasy points to D/ST, last 4 defenses scored double digits
- **Rams Stats:** 4th in turnover rate, 6th in pressure rate, 6th in EPA/play allowed
- **Drop:** Titans D/ST immediately
- **Action:** Add Wednesday/Thursday for Sunday morning London game

**2. Seahawks D/ST (SEA) - PRIORITY #2**
- **Projection:** 5.9 points
- **Matchup:** vs Texans (Monday Night Football)
- **Why Strong:** 7 sacks last week, Texans OL allows 2+ sacks every game
- **Stats:** Top-5 in pressure rate and pass rush win rate
- **Drop:** Titans D/ST if Rams claimed
- **Action:** Backup option, plays Monday night

**3. Jerry Jeudy (WR, CLE) - DEPTH CONSIDERATION**
- **Projection:** 12.2 points
- **Why:** MHJ injury creates WR depth need, solid WR3/4 option
- **Issue:** Already have 7 WRs, only add if MHJ ruled OUT
- **Action:** Monitor Wednesday/Thursday, add if needed

### DO NOT ADD
- **Joe Burrow (QB)** - Available but you have Jordan Love (no QB depth needed)
- **Harrison Butker (K)** - Jake Elliott sufficient, not worth roster spot

## Trade Strategy: Leveraging New Trade Analyzer

### Trade Analyzer Results

**Your Roster Composition (Per Automated Analysis):**
- **Strengths:** WR depth (7 total, 2 surplus)
- **Weaknesses:** QB depth (MEDIUM need), RB depth (HIGH need), D/ST (HIGH need)
- **Injured Players:** Bucky Irving, MHJ, Darnell Mooney, Titans D/ST

**League Landscape (Automated Scan):**
- **Desperate Teams (2-4 or worse):** Ryan's Rowdy Team (2-4), Auto DraftKings (2-4), Torta Pounders (1-5)
- **Injury-Riddled Teams:** Meat Pistols (5 injured), The Warsaw Pact (5 injured), Wookie of the Year (5 injured)

**Trade Analyzer Conclusion:**
"No clear trade opportunities identified at this time" due to 0.0 projections early in week.

### Manual Trade Recommendations

Despite automated analyzer limitations (early-week data), here are strategic trade targets:

**TRADE PACKAGE #1: Consolidate WR Depth for RB Upgrade**

**Target:** Teams with RB surplus and WR injuries (Meat Pistols, Warsaw Pact, Wookie of the Year)

**GIVE:** Keenan Allen + Hollywood Brown (or Darnell Mooney)
**GET:** Mid-tier RB1 (targeting: Breece Hall, Kenneth Walker, James Conner tier)
**Rationale:**
- You have 7 WRs, they need WR help badly
- Allen has name value despite age 33
- Hollywood has KC pedigree
- Consolidate 2 bench pieces for 1 starter

**TRADE PACKAGE #2: Sell Cam Skattebo High**

**Target:** Teams desperate for RB help (Torta Pounders, Auto DraftKings, Ryan's Rowdy Team)

**GIVE:** Cam Skattebo + Keenan Allen
**GET:** Elite WR1 (targeting: Amon-Ra St. Brown, CeeDee Lamb, Davante Adams tier)
**Rationale:**
- Skattebo just had 25-point explosion (Week 6)
- Sell-high window is NOW before regression
- Upgrade WR corps with proven stud

**TRADE PACKAGE #3: Target Specific Team Weaknesses**

**Option A - Target: Ryan's Rowdy Team (2-4, #10)**
- **Their Roster Strength:** ELITE RB depth (Javonte Williams 17.6, Ashton Jeanty 16.4, D'Andre Swift 15.7)
- **Their Need:** WR depth (only have Chris Olave, Ladd McConkey as solid WRs)
- **Your Offer:** Tetairoa McMillan (12.6) + Darnell Mooney (10.2)
- **Your Target:** Javonte Williams (DAL, 17.6 proj) OR Ashton Jeanty (LV, 16.4 proj)
- **Rationale:** They have THREE RB1s and can afford to trade one for two WRs
- **Desperation Factor:** High (2-4 record, need wins now)
- **Value:** Even trade (McMillan 12.6 + Mooney 10.2 = 22.8 for Williams 17.6 = slight overpay but worth RB1)

**Option B - Target: Torta Pounders Football Club (1-5, #12)**
- **Their Roster Strength:** ELITE WR corps (CeeDee Lamb 19.6, Davante Adams 19.3, Nico Collins 17.7)
- **Their Need:** RB depth (only Breece Hall good, rest under 10 pts)
- **Your Offer:** Cam Skattebo (14.0) + Keenan Allen (13.5)
- **Your Target:** Breece Hall (NYJ, 16.2 proj) OR one of their elite WRs (CeeDee/Davante)
- **Rationale:** 1-5 record = DESPERATE, they need RB help, you consolidate for elite player
- **Desperation Factor:** EXTREME (1-5 record, will overpay to avoid 1-17 season)
- **Value:** Good trade (Skattebo 14.0 + Allen 13.5 = 27.5 for Breece 16.2 = you overpay but get RB1)

**Option C - Target: Auto DraftKings (2-4, #11)**
- **Their Roster Strength:** Jonathan Taylor (24.4 proj RB!), Justin Jefferson (18.3 WR)
- **Their Need:** RB2 depth (Kenneth Gainwell 13.0, Michael Carter 9.4 are weak)
- **Your Offer:** Cam Skattebo (14.0) + Tetairoa McMillan (12.6)
- **Your Target:** Jonathan Taylor (IND, 24.4 proj) - ELITE RB1
- **Rationale:** Taylor is THE prize, worth big package if they bite
- **Desperation Factor:** Medium (2-4 record but solid roster)
- **Value:** Fair (Skattebo 14.0 + McMillan 12.6 = 26.6 for Taylor 24.4 = slight overpay but RB1!)

### Trade Execution Tips

1. **Timing:** Message Wednesday/Thursday after projections update (non-zero values)
2. **Messaging:** Emphasize how trade fills THEIR positional weakness
3. **Starting Point:** Lead with fair offer, don't lowball desperate teams
4. **Leverage:** Use "7 WRs, need to consolidate" as negotiation angle

## Key Lineup Decisions

### Decision #1: Rashee Rice Immediate Start

**Context:** Returns from 6-game suspension, hasn't played since Week 4 of 2024 (knee injury)

**START Rashee Rice over Keenan Allen:**
- Andy Reid and Mahomes publicly excited about return
- Chiefs offense needs WR1 (3-3 record, struggling)
- Rice was WR1 before suspension/injury
- Allen declining at age 33, limited targets

**Risk Factors:**
- Rust from year-long absence
- Snap count potentially limited Week 7
- Unknown chemistry with Mahomes after long layoff

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH (start, but temper expectations to 8-12 pts)

### Decision #2: Defense Streaming - Rams vs Seahawks

**Rams D/ST (6.7 proj) - RECOMMENDED**
- **Pros:** Jaguars are elite matchup (3rd-worst vs D/ST), London game (earlier start)
- **Cons:** None significant
- **Verdict:** TOP PRIORITY ADD

**Seahawks D/ST (5.9 proj) - BACKUP**
- **Pros:** 7 sacks last week, Texans OL porous
- **Cons:** Monday night (late confirmation), defensive injuries
- **Verdict:** SOLID BACKUP if Rams claimed

**Drop:** Titans D/ST (no question, immediate drop)

### Decision #3: FLEX - Tetairoa McMillan Locked In

**START McMillan over:**
- Keenan Allen (declining role)
- Darnell Mooney (WR2 in ATL, lower ceiling)
- Hassan Haskins (committee back)

**Why McMillan:**
- 34% target share (elite opportunity)
- CAR offense funnels targets to him
- Consistent 8-12 point floor in PPR

### Decision #4: RB2 - Cam Skattebo Over Hassan Haskins

**Cam Skattebo:**
- 25 points Week 6 (career game)
- Elite volume (20+ touches)
- PHI run defense beatable

**Hassan Haskins:**
- Limited role in LAC committee
- 4-6 point ceiling
- Blocked by J.K. Dobbins/Gus Edwards

**Verdict:** START Skattebo, sell high in trade if possible

---

## Matchup Analysis: vs Moms rules

**Projected Score:** Valued Customers 114.5, Moms rules 92.9

**Their Likely Weaknesses (Need to Verify):**
- Puka Nacua injury (if on their roster)
- WR depth issues (league-wide carnage)
- Check their roster Wednesday for specific vulnerabilities

**Your Path to Victory:**
1. Rashee Rice delivers 12+ points in return game
2. Dobbins + Skattebo combine for 25-30 points
3. Defense streams 7+ points (Rams/Seahawks)
4. Jordan Love bounces back post-bye (20+ pts)

**How You Lose:**
- Rice struggles with rust/snap count (under 6 pts)
- Opponent's top players boom unexpectedly
- Defense streams bust (under 3 pts)
- MHJ ruled OUT, losing WR depth flexibility

**Win Probability:** 70% (strong favorite, should win barring injuries)

---

## Blocking Strategy: NOT RECOMMENDED

**Opponent Situation:** Moms rules (3-3, 4th place)

**Why No Blocking This Week:**
1. **No Clear Desperation:** They're 3-3, tied with you
2. **Top FAs Not Significant:** Rams D/ST (6.7) vs Seahawks D/ST (5.9) only 0.8 point gap
3. **Your Needs Priority:** Upgrading YOUR defense more important than blocking theirs
4. **Droppable Players:** Cade Otton borderline, but you need TE depth with Engram only starter

**Blocking Checklist Failed:**
- [ ] ~~Opponent has injury/bye at position~~ (unknown, need to check)
- [ ] ~~Top FA is 5+ points better than #2 option~~ (Rams only 0.8 > Seahawks)
- [ ] ~~You have droppable player~~ (Otton borderline but needed)
- [ ] ~~This is current week opponent~~ (YES, but other conditions fail)

**Verdict:** Focus on strengthening YOUR roster, not weakening theirs
