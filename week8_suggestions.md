## CRITICAL: Week 8 Bye Weeks

**YOUR AFFECTED PLAYERS:**

**Impact:** Missing your top WR from Week 7. Lineup adjustments required.

## Recommended Starting Lineup

| Position | Player | Team | Opponent | Game Time | Proj | Decision |
|----------|--------|------|----------|-----------|------|----------|
| **QB** | Jordan Love | GB | @ PIT | Sun 8:20 PM | 17.2 | ✅ START |
| **RB** | Cam Skattebo | NYG | vs PHI | Sun 1:00 PM | 14.3 | ✅ START |
| **RB** | J.K. Dobbins | DEN | vs DAL | Sun 4:25 PM | 13.4 | ✅ START |
| **WR** | Tetairoa McMillan | CAR | @ BUF | Sun 1:00 PM | 13.4 | ✅ START |
| **WR** | Keenan Allen | LAC | @ MIN | Sun 4:05 PM | 16.0 | ✅ START |
| **TE** | Evan Engram | DEN | vs DAL | Sun 4:25 PM | 9.9 | ✅ START |
| **FLEX** | Rashee Rice | KC | vs WSH | **Mon 8:15 PM** | 17.2 | ✅ START |
| **K** | Jake Elliott | PHI | @ NYG | Sun 1:00 PM | 8.4 | ✅ START |
| **D/ST** | Falcons D/ST | ATL | vs MIA | Sun 1:00 PM | 6.7 | ✅ START |

**Total Projected:** 116.6 points

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - Flex Positioning Strategy:**

**Rashee Rice is in the FLEX** because he plays Monday night (8:15 PM ET) - the LATEST game of the week. This is CRITICAL for roster flexibility:

- ✅ **If early player injured:** McMillan (Sun 1 PM) or Allen (Sun 4 PM) gets injured → Can swap Tyjae Spears, Darnell Mooney, or any RB/WR/TE into flex
- ❌ **If Rice in WR slot:** Rice gets injured Monday → Locked into finding another WR only (no RB flex option)

**Rule:** Always put your latest-playing game in FLEX to preserve maximum flexibility. League locks positions individually at game time.

## Critical Lineup Decisions

### Decision 1: Rashee Rice Returns from Suspension

**Rashee Rice (17.2 proj) vs WSH:**
- **Suspension ended** after Week 6 (6-game ban for personal conduct violation)
- **Week 7 return:** 7 receptions on 10 targets, 42 yards, **2 TDs**
- Led Chiefs in targets and receptions in first game back
- Patrick Mahomes' favorite pass catcher is BACK

**Multi-Source Analysis:**
- ESPN Projection: 17.2 pts
- FantasyPros: Top-12 WR this week
- Expert Consensus: Must-start after dominant Week 7 return

**DECISION: START with HIGH confidence**
**Rationale:** Rice immediately reclaimed his WR1 role. Double-digit targets in return game = elite floor and ceiling.

---

### Decision 2: FLEX - Tetairoa McMillan vs Tyjae Spears

**Tetairoa McMillan (WR, CAR) - 13.4 proj @ BUF:**
- **Expert Upgrade:** Ranked WR17 in Week 8 PPR (top-12 consideration)
- **Matchup:** Bills tough defense (#7 vs WR), but Panthers may throw heavily if trailing
- **Volume:** 2nd on team in targets Week 7 (5 targets)
- **PPR Advantage:** Full PPR league favors WR over RB in flex

**Tyjae Spears (RB, TEN) - 8.9 proj vs IND:**
- **Tough Matchup:** Colts rank #6 vs RB (90.3 yards/game allowed)
- **Volume Concern:** Tony Pollard primary back (24 touches vs 17 for Spears last 2 weeks)
- **Defensive Strength:** No RB has rushed for 100+ yards vs IND this season

**DECISION: Start Tetairoa McMillan in FLEX**
**Rationale:**
- 4.5 point projection advantage
- Experts upgraded McMillan to WR1 status this week
- PPR format favors reception volume
- Spears faces elite run defense with limited TD upside

---

### Decision 3: TE - Evan Engram vs Cade Otton

**Both project 9.9 points - true coin flip decision.**

**Evan Engram (DEN) vs DAL:**
- Consistent target share in Denver offense
- Matchup: Cowboys rank #17 vs TE (neutral)
- Higher floor, proven veteran

**Cade Otton (TB) @ NO:**
- Matchup: Saints rank middle-of-pack vs TE
- Upside: Could see more targets with WRs potentially limited

**DECISION: Start Evan Engram (slight edge)**
**Rationale:** When projections are identical, go with the more consistent veteran option. Engram has been reliable all season.

## Defense/Special Teams Deep Dive

### Falcons D/ST vs Miami - Elite Streaming Play

**Expert Rankings:** #3 defense for Week 8 (Pro Football Network, Roto Street Journal)

**Why Atlanta is a TOP-3 Play:**

**Miami's Offensive Collapse:**
- Surrendering **7th-most fantasy points to opposing defenses**
- Scored only 6 points Week 7 with **3 turnovers** vs Cleveland
- Tua Tagovailoa: **6 INTs in last 2 games**
- O-line allowed multiple sacks in **5 of 7 games**
- Dolphins have "graduated from falling apart to flat-out broken"

**Atlanta's Defensive Dominance:**
- Ranked **#2 in total defense**, **#1 in pass defense**
- Allowing only 20 points per game (#8 in scoring defense)
- Top 10 in pressure rate (Tua struggles under pressure)
- **#1 vs pass**, **#2 in yards allowed per game**

**Game Script:** Falcons favored at home, Miami offense dysfunctional

**Projected:** 6.7 pts (conservative - could easily hit 8-10 with sacks/turnovers)

**Available Alternatives:**
- Chargers D/ST: 6.1 proj (inferior matchup)
- 49ers D/ST: 5.3 proj
- Jets D/ST: 5.9 proj

**DECISION: Keep Falcons D/ST - do not stream**
**Rationale:** You already own the #3 ranked defense for Week 8. No need to make a move.

## Waiver Wire Recommendations

### Priority 1: Tyler Allgeier (RB, ATL) - BYE WEEK DEPTH

**Why Add:**
- **Available:** Confirmed on waiver wire (7.3 projection)
- **Elite Matchup:** vs Miami (allows **2nd-most fantasy points to RBs**)
- **Recent Success:** Browns' Judkins scored 3 TDs vs Miami Week 7
- **Volume:** Falcons lead NFL in rushing attempts per game (31.8)
- **Game Script:** Falcons likely leading = rushing volume in 2nd half

**Multi-Source Analysis:**
- ESPN Projection: 7.3 pts
- Expert Consensus: RB3/Flex start this week
- Miami allows 170 rushing yards/game over last 4 weeks
- In Falcons' 3 wins (positive game script), Allgeier hit double-digits each time

**Usage Scenario:**
- **Week 8:** Flex/RB3 option if needed (Bucky Irving still OUT)
- **Future Bye Weeks:** RB depth insurance
- **Weeks 10-14:** Potential flex plays in favorable matchups

**Who to Drop:** Justin Fields (see analysis below)

---

### Priority 2: DROP Justin Fields Immediately - Comprehensive Analysis

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** Jordan Love's bye was **Week 5 (already passed)**, not Week 10. You don't need QB insurance.

**What Happened to Justin Fields - Week 7 Disaster:**

**The Benching:**
- Jets **benched Fields at halftime** vs Panthers in Week 7 loss (13-6)
- Replaced by backup Tyrod Taylor after ineffective first half
- Fields: 6-of-12 passing, 46 yards, 0 TDs before being pulled
- Coach Aaron Glenn: "We needed a spark"

**The Crisis:**
- Jets are **0-7** - NFL's only winless team
- **Haven't scored a TD in 2 weeks** (Week 6 vs DEN, Week 7 vs CAR)
- Week 6: Fields had **negative 10 net passing yards** vs Broncos
- Owner Woody Johnson **publicly threw Fields under the bus** at league meetings Oct 21

**Fields' Reaction:**
- "I was a little bit [surprised]. But at the same time, I can't be mad at the decision."
- Acknowledged the team needed a change

**QB Battle for Week 8:**
- Coach Glenn **won't commit** to Fields or Taylor as starter
- Tyrod Taylor (backup) now day-to-day with knee injury
- Fields may start Week 8 out of desperation, not merit
- **Risk of mid-game benching** if he struggles again

**Trade Rumors:**
- Ravens, Raiders, and Colts mentioned as potential trade destinations
- Jets signed Fields to 2-year, $40M contract ($30M guaranteed) - expensive mistake
- Trade deadline Nov 5 - Jets may cut losses

**Fantasy Expert Consensus - UNANIMOUS DROP:**

**1QB Leagues:**
- "You can move on from him. In 1QB leagues, drop Fields." - FantasyPros
- "No longer a starting QB, can't justify rostering him" - Pro Football Network
- "Fields is droppable" - Fantasy Six Pack (Week 8 Cut List)

**2QB/Superflex Leagues:**
- "Depends on your depth, but he's dragging lineups down" - FanDuel
- "Upside stash only if you have deep bench" - Roto Street Journal

**Why Fields Has ZERO Value in 1QB Leagues:**

1. **Not Starting:** Benched, may not play Week 8 or beyond
2. **Mid-Game Benching Risk:** If he does start, could be pulled again
3. **Talent Concerns:** 845 yards, 4 TDs through 6 starts (terrible)
4. **Rushing Upside Gone:** Zero red zone rushing attempts since Week 6
5. **Love's Bye Already Passed:** Week 5 (not Week 10) - don't need backup
6. **Streaming Options Available:** 15+ startable QBs on waivers (see below)

**Available QB Streaming Options (if Love gets injured):**

All available RIGHT NOW on waivers:
- **Tyrod Taylor (NYJ):** 17.9 proj - replaced Fields, may start Week 8
- **Marcus Mariota (WSH):** 16.9 proj
- **Carson Wentz (MIN):** 16.7 proj
- **Michael Penix Jr. (ATL):** 16.3 proj
- **Andy Dalton (CAR):** 15.8 proj
- **Spencer Rattler (NO):** 15.7 proj

**All project higher than Fields' 0.9 this week.**

**FINAL VERDICT: DROP JUSTIN FIELDS FOR TYLER ALLGEIER**

**Why This Move Makes Sense:**

✅ **Love's bye already passed** - No QB insurance needed
✅ **Fields has zero value** - Benched, not starting, possibly traded soon
✅ **RB depth critical** - Bucky Irving OUT, only 2 healthy starters
✅ **Allgeier elite matchup** - Miami allows 2nd-most fantasy points to RBs
✅ **15+ QB streamers available** - Can grab one if Love gets injured later
✅ **Trade deadline approaching** - Need RB depth to evaluate trades

**Execution:**
1. **Drop:** Justin Fields (0.9 proj, benched, no starting role)
2. **Add:** Tyler Allgeier (7.3 proj, RB3/flex this week, RB depth)
3. **If Love gets injured later:** Stream Tyrod Taylor, Penix Jr., or Wentz

**The Fields Era is Over - Don't Hold Dead Weight**

---

### Other Available Options (Monitor, Don't Add Yet)

**RBs:**
- Kareem Hunt (7.0 proj) - **AVOID:** Ankle injury Week 7, droppable per experts
- Tyrone Tracy Jr. (5.3 proj) - Low volume backup
- Joe Mixon (0.0 proj) - **AVOID:** OUT FOR SEASON (foot injury)

**WRs:**
- Elic Ayomanor (9.0 proj) - Great matchup vs IND, but you have WR depth
- Jayden Higgins (9.1 proj) - Deep league option
- Hollywood Brown (6.6 proj) - Already evaluated and dropped Week 7

**D/ST:**
- Rams D/ST - ON BYE (unavailable)

**Verdict:** No urgent waiver moves needed beyond monitoring Tyler Allgeier.
