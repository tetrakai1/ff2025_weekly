## Position-by-Position Analysis

### QB Decision: Jacoby Brissett (START)

**Jacoby Brissett (ARI @ TB, Sun 1:00 PM)**
- **ESPN Projection (IBM watsonx):** 17.2 pts
- **LLM Projection (Claude Opus 4.5):** 20.0 pts (HIGH confidence)
- **Recommendation:** START

**LLM Reasoning:**
- MC density shows MODERATE mode at 20.0 (71% probability) - extremely consistent
- 18+ fantasy points in all 5 games as starter this season
- Tampa Bay 21st vs QB - middling matchup
- MHJ potentially returning = more weapons
- Weather: 81F, clear, 7 mph wind - perfect conditions

**Why Not Jordan Love?** Already played Thursday (25.8 actual). Brissett was the right call pre-game given TB matchup vs DET's stronger defense.

### WR Analysis

#### Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA vs MIN, Sun 4:05 PM)
- **ESPN Projection:** 21.9 pts
- **LLM Projection:** 23.0 pts (HIGH confidence)
- **Mode:** MODERATE (81% probability per MC density)
- **Recommendation:** MUST START

**LLM Reasoning:**
- WR2 Expert Consensus Ranking - elite status
- 96.5 receiving yards prop (very high) - Vegas expects big game
- MC density shows MODERATE mode peaks at 22-23 pts, BOOM potential to 37+
- Rain expected (80% chance) may slightly limit ceiling but volume guaranteed
- MIN defense middling vs WR

#### Tetairoa McMillan (CAR vs LAR, Sun 1:00 PM)
- **ESPN Projection:** 13.2 pts
- **LLM Projection:** 16.5 pts (MEDIUM confidence)
- **Mode:** MODERATE
- **Recommendation:** START (FLEX)

**LLM Reasoning:**
- WR19 ECR - solid starter
- LAR 21st vs WR (improving but still vulnerable)
- 65.5 receiving yards prop, +145 anytime TD
- CAR 10.5-point underdog = garbage time passing volume
- MC shows MODERATE at 16.9 (40%), BUST risk at 50%

#### Rashee Rice - COMPLETED
- **Actual:** 29.4 pts (5 rec, 97 yds, 2 TD)
- **Prior LLM Projection:** 25.9 pts
- **Result:** BOOM as predicted - outperformed projection by 3.5 pts

---

### RB Analysis

#### Bucky Irving (TB vs ARI, Sun 1:00 PM)
- **ESPN Projection:** 11.8 pts
- **LLM Projection:** 14.0 pts (MEDIUM confidence)
- **Mode:** BUST (42% probability)
- **Recommendation:** START (limited options)

**LLM Reasoning:**
- QUESTIONABLE with foot injury - first game back
- Coach mentioned "hot hand" approach with White/Tucker
- Rushing yards prop only 38.5 (low)
- MC density shows BUST mode at 14.2 most likely
- ARI defense allows rushing yards but limited ceiling in committee

#### Tyjae Spears (TEN vs JAX, Sun 1:00 PM)
- **ESPN Projection:** 9.9 pts
- **LLM Projection:** 8.0 pts (LOW confidence)
- **Mode:** MODERATE
- **Recommendation:** START (no alternatives)

**LLM Reasoning:**
- RB45 ECR - SIT territory but we lack options
- JAX run defense improved (fewest rush yards since Week 8)
- TEN 7-point underdog = negative game script
- Splits backfield with Tony Pollard
- MC shows MODERATE at 8.0 (71%), ceiling capped

---

### TE Analysis

#### Juwan Johnson (NO @ MIA, Sun 1:00 PM)
- **ESPN Projection:** 8.7 pts
- **LLM Projection:** 12.5 pts (MEDIUM confidence)
- **Mode:** MODERATE
- **Recommendation:** START

**LLM Reasoning:**
- TE9 ECR - solid streaming option
- MC shows MODERATE at 12.6 (63%)
- +320 TD odds (unlikely to score) caps ceiling
- But consistent target share in NO offense
- MIA improving vs TE but still exploitable

#### Evan Engram - BENCH
- **LLM Projection:** 6.0 pts (LOW confidence)
- DEN run-heavy offense limits TE targets
- TE24 ECR = SIT recommendation
- Monday game gives flexibility but Juwan is better play

---

### K/DST Analysis

#### Jason Myers (SEA vs MIN, Sun 4:05 PM)
- **ESPN Projection:** 8.5 pts
- **LLM Projection:** 10.0 pts (MEDIUM confidence)
- **Recommendation:** START

**Reasoning:**
- K2 ECR - elite kicker
- Rain may slightly reduce FG accuracy
- SEA offense should move ball = opportunities
- MC shows ~45% each for BOOM (14) and MODERATE (9)

#### Rams D/ST (LAR @ CAR, Sun 1:00 PM)
- **ESPN Projection:** 7.5 pts
- **LLM Projection:** 9.0 pts (HIGH confidence)
- **Recommendation:** START

**Reasoning:**
- DST3 ECR - elite matchup
- CAR implied total only ~16 pts
- High sack/turnover potential vs weak CAR offense
- MC shows MODERATE at 8.8 (81%) - consistent floor

---

## Waiver Wire Notes

**Streaming Options If Needed:**

1. **Hunter Henry (TE, NE)** - 11.2 proj, available on waivers
2. **Browns D/ST** - vs SF, 5.1 proj - consider if you want to drop Rams (don't)
3. **Cooper Kupp (WR, SEA)** - 8.4 proj, could be desperate add

**No Urgent Adds Needed** - Current roster should handle Week 13.
