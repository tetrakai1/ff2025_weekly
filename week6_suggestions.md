## 🔍 KEY CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### RB2 Change: Hassan Haskins Instead of Cam Skattebo
**Original:** Cam Skattebo at RB2 (PLAYED Thursday - 25.0 pts)
**Updated:** Hassan Haskins at RB2 for Sunday games

**Hassan Haskins Analysis (LAC):**
- **Projection:** 11.0 points vs Miami
- **Role:** Split backfield duties with Kimani Vidal after Najee Harris season-ending injury and Omarion Hampton to IR
- **Opportunity:** Chargers run-heavy offense provides guaranteed touches
- **Matchup:** Miami defense exploitable
- **Verdict:** **START** - Best available RB option with Irving out

**Backup Option:** Could flex Hollywood Brown (9.6 proj) or Marvin Harrison Jr. (12.4 proj, risky due to Murray status)

### Defense Reality Check: Titans D/ST
**Original Recommendation:** Packers D/ST (Priority #1) > Broncos > Steelers > Titans (Tier 2)
**What You Got:** Titans D/ST

**Titans D/ST Analysis (@ LV):**
- **Projection:** 6-9 points vs Las Vegas Raiders
- **Why Decent:** Geno Smith has 9 interceptions (league-leading), recorded 3rd multi-INT game in Week 5
- **Availability Status:** Was recommended as "backup option if top 3 unavailable"
- **Reality:** Packers/Broncos/Steelers likely rostered by other teams
- **Verdict:** **ACCEPTABLE STREAM** - Not ideal, but better than keeping injured Seahawks

**Note:** Packers D/ST still available on waivers! Consider dropping Cade Otton for Packers if you want the upgrade (Packers coming off bye, projected 9-12 pts).

---

## 📊 UPDATED POSITION-BY-POSITION ANALYSIS

### QUARTERBACK

#### **STARTER: Jordan Love (GB)**
- **Projection:** 19.3 points vs Cincinnati
- **Game Time:** Sunday 1:00 PM ET at Lambeau Field
- **Analysis:** Coming off bye week, well-rested and healthy. Faces Cincinnati's 13th-ranked pass defense. Bengals' offense has struggled without Burrow, suggesting positive game script.
- **Key Factor:** Packers will likely jump ahead early, Love will pass to extend lead
- **Verdict:** **MUST START** - Top-12 QB1 with high floor

---

### RUNNING BACKS

#### **RB1: J.K. Dobbins (DEN)**
- **Projection:** 16.0 points @ New York Jets
- **Game Time:** Sunday 9:30 AM ET (London game at Tottenham Stadium)
- **Analysis:** **ELITE MATCHUP** - Jets defense vulnerable to pass-catching RBs in PPR. Dobbins maintains 71% snap share as clear RB1. Denver's OL ranks 2nd in NFL.
- **Game Script:** Broncos favored on neutral field
- **PPR Value:** Averaging 3-4 receptions per game
- **Injury Check:** ✅ Fully healthy, practiced all week
- **Verdict:** **MUST START** - RB1 volume with elite matchup

#### **RB2: Hassan Haskins (LAC)**
- **Projection:** 11.0 points vs Miami
- **Game Time:** Sunday 4:05 PM ET
- **Analysis:** Splitting carries with Kimani Vidal after Najee Harris (season-ending injury) and Omarion Hampton (IR, out 4+ weeks). Chargers run-heavy offense = guaranteed touches.
- **Opportunity:** 12-15 touches expected in committee
- **Matchup:** Miami defense ranks bottom-10
- **Risk:** Not a bellcow, touchdown-dependent for ceiling
- **Verdict:** **START** - Best available option with Irving out

#### **BENCH: Cam Skattebo (NYG) - ALREADY PLAYED**
- **Final Stats:** 25.0 fantasy points (19 carries, 98 yds, 3 TDs, 2 rec, 12 yds)
- **Result:** MASSIVE SUCCESS ✅

#### **BENCH: Bucky Irving (TB) - OUT 2+ WEEKS**
- **Injury Status:** Shoulder subluxation + foot sprain (OUT Week 6)
- **Timeline:** Expected to return Week 8
- **Action:** **HOLD** - Do not drop, will be RB1 when healthy

---

### WIDE RECEIVERS

#### **WR1: Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA)**
- **Projection:** 17.9 points vs Jacksonville
- **Game Time:** Sunday 4:05 PM ET at Lumen Field
- **Analysis:** **ELITE WR1 STATUS** - ESPN's overall WR7 for Week 6. Caught 4-of-5 targets for 79 yards in Week 5 Thursday night. Unquestioned alpha receiver.
- **Matchup:** Jaguars defense exploitable through the air
- **Target Share:** 8+ targets consistently
- **PPR Gold:** Slot receiver role = 6-8 catches per game
- **Injury Check:** ✅ Fully healthy
- **Verdict:** **MUST START** - Set-and-forget WR1

#### **WR2: Keenan Allen (LAC)**
- **Projection:** 15.4 points vs Miami
- **Game Time:** Sunday 4:05 PM ET
- **Analysis:** At age 33, Allen is currently WR10 in PPR with 3 TDs through 5 games. Herbert's trusted red-zone favorite (6 red-zone targets, 4th among WRs).
- **Matchup:** Miami defense ranks bottom-10 in pass defense
- **Trade Window:** This is peak value - aging veterans decline as season progresses
- **Injury Check:** ✅ Healthy but age 33 is risk factor
- **Verdict:** **START** - Excellent matchup, but shop in trades after this week

#### **FLEX: Tetairoa McMillan (CAR)**
- **Projection:** 14.5 points @ Dallas
- **Game Time:** Sunday 1:00 PM ET
- **Analysis:** Carolina's unquestioned WR1 with elite 34% target share. Commands 8+ targets every game regardless of matchup.
- **Matchup:** Dallas defense ranks 17th vs WRs (neutral)
- **Target Volume:** No competition for targets (closest WR is 15% target share)
- **TD Regression:** Only 1 TD through 5 games despite elite volume - positive regression expected
- **Injury Check:** ✅ Fully healthy
- **Verdict:** **START** - Volume justifies flex spot, elite PPR floor

#### **BENCH: Marvin Harrison Jr. (ARI) - QUESTIONABLE QB SITUATION**
- **Projection:** 12.4 points vs Colts (IF Murray plays)
- **Status:** Kyler Murray QUESTIONABLE (foot injury, Jacoby Brissett backup)
- **Risk:** If Murray sits, MHJ's value tanks significantly
- **Action:** **BENCH** - Too much uncertainty, start Allen instead

#### **BENCH: Hollywood Brown (KC)**
- **Projection:** 9.6 points
- **Analysis:** Limited role behind Kelce and Xavier Worthy
- **Action:** **BENCH + SHOP IN TRADES** - Name value exceeds production

#### **BENCH: Darnell Mooney (ATL) - QUESTIONABLE**
- **Status:** QUESTIONABLE (hamstring), DNP Friday
- **Game:** Monday Night Football vs Bills
- **Action:** **EXPECT TO SIT** - Unlikely to play

#### **BENCH: Rashee Rice (KC) - SUSPENDED**
- **Status:** Suspended through Week 6 (6-game suspension)
- **Return:** Eligible Week 7 (Oct 19 vs Las Vegas)
- **Action:** **DO NOT DROP** - Immediate WR2 value upon return

---

### TIGHT END

#### **STARTER: Evan Engram (DEN)**
- **Projection:** 8.9 points @ New York Jets
- **Game Time:** Sunday 9:30 AM ET (London)
- **Analysis:** Established as Denver's TE1 with consistent 5-7 target share. Jets exploitable by pass-catching TEs.
- **PPR Value:** Catches 4-6 passes per game
- **Injury Check:** ✅ Fully healthy
- **Verdict:** **START** - Solid TE option, better than streaming

#### **BENCH: Cade Otton (TB)**
- **Projection:** 6.9 points
- **Status:** Still on roster (not dropped as suggested)
- **Drop Candidate:** Could drop for Packers D/ST upgrade or other waiver adds

---

### KICKER

#### **JAKE ELLIOTT (PHI) - ALREADY PLAYED**
- **Final Stats:** 5.0 fantasy points (1 FG, 2 XP)
- **Game:** Eagles lost to Giants 34-17 on Thursday
- **Result:** Below projection (8.3 expected), but acceptable given game script

---

### DEFENSE/SPECIAL TEAMS

#### **STARTER: Titans D/ST (TEN)**
- **Projection:** 6-9 points @ Las Vegas Raiders
- **Game Time:** Sunday 4:05 PM ET
- **Why Starting:**
  - Geno Smith has league-leading 9 interceptions
  - Smith recorded 3rd multi-INT game in Week 5
  - Raiders turnover-prone offense
- **Reality Check:** Not the ideal stream (Packers/Broncos/Steelers were better), but acceptable
- **Verdict:** **START** - Better than injured Seahawks you dropped

#### **UPGRADE AVAILABLE: Packers D/ST**
- **Status:** Still available on free agent list!
- **Projection:** 9-12 points vs Cincinnati
- **Why Elite:** Fresh off bye, home at Lambeau (held DET+WAS to combined 6 pts), Joe Flacco turnover-prone
- **Action:** **CONSIDER ADDING** - Drop Cade Otton for Packers D/ST if you want the upgrade (3-5 extra points possible)

---

## 💰 TRADE STRATEGY: SELL KEENAN ALLEN AFTER THIS WEEK

### THE WINDOW IS NOW

**Keenan Allen Current Value:**
- WR10 in PPR (15.4 points/game)
- 3 touchdowns through 5 games
- Age 33 - production cliff likely coming
- Having excellent Miami matchup Sunday

**Why Sell After Week 6:**
1. If he has big game vs MIA (18-20+ pts), his value peaks
2. If he has quiet game, sell before further decline
3. Age 33 = injury risk increases every week
4. Rashee Rice returns Week 7 = you'll have WR depth

**Target Trade Packages:**
- **Allen + Hollywood Brown** for elite RB1 (Derrick Henry, TreVeyon Henderson)
- **Allen + bench piece** for younger WR1 (target teams desperate after injuries)

**Priority Targets:**
- Teams that lost Malik Nabers (ACL) or Tyreek Hill (knee)
- RB-desperate teams (Torta Pounders at 1-4, Ryan's Rowdy Team at 1-4)
- Teams with Lamar Jackson out (may panic trade)

## 📈 UPDATED WEEK 6 MATCHUP OUTLOOK

### vs Smooth Roosters (3-2 Record)

**Current Score:**
- **You:** 30.0 points (Skattebo 25.0 + Elliott 5.0)
- **Opponent:** 0.0 points
- **Lead:** +30.0 points ✓

**Remaining Projections:**
- **Your Remaining Players:** 104.6 points projected
- **Their Total Lineup:** 114.4 points projected
- **Updated Win Probability:** 70% (was 60% before Thursday)

**Why You're Favored:**

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR SUNDAY

### BEFORE SUNDAY GAMES (By 12:45 PM ET):

**ROSTER DECISIONS:**
- [ ] **EARLY GAME ALERT:** Dobbins & Engram play at 9:30 AM ET (London game)
- [ ] **Set lineup by 9:15 AM ET** for London game players
- [ ] **Verify Kyler Murray status** - If Murray out, MHJ value tanks (not starting anyway)
- [ ] **Check weather** for outdoor games (Lambeau, Dallas, LAC)
- [ ] **Final injury check** on all starters

**OPTIONAL UPGRADE:**
- [ ] Consider dropping Cade Otton for Packers D/ST (upgrade from Titans)
- [ ] Would gain 3-5 projected points at defense position

### DURING SUNDAY GAMES:
- [ ] Monitor Titans D/ST performance (4:05 PM ET game)
- [ ] Track London game (Dobbins, Engram at 9:30 AM ET)
- [ ] Watch for any in-game injuries

### TRADE PREP (THIS WEEK):
- [ ] Identify Nabers/Hill owners in your league
- [ ] Message 2-3 teams about Keenan Allen
- [ ] Target Torta Pounders (1-4, RB desperate)
- [ ] Aim to complete trade by Week 7 before Rice returns

---

## 🎯 FINAL GAME PLAN SUMMARY

### What's Going Right ✅
1. **Cam Skattebo DELIVERED** - 25.0 pts on Thursday (week-winning performance)
2. **Waiver moves executed** - Hassan Haskins added, Titans D/ST streaming
3. **Dropped dead weight** - Tua and Seahawks correctly cut
4. **30-point lead** heading into Sunday games

### What Needs Attention ⚠️
1. **Michael Carter not added** - Priority RB still available if needed
2. **Cade Otton still rostered** - Could drop for Packers D/ST upgrade
3. **Titans D/ST** - Not ideal stream but acceptable (6-9 proj)
4. **Kyler Murray uncertainty** - Impacts MHJ bench value

### Keys to Winning Week 6 🏆
1. ✅ **Protect your lead** - 30-point cushion is huge
2. ✅ **Dobbins must perform** - Elite matchup vs NYJ (16.0 proj)
3. ✅ **JSN + Love stack** - Combined 37.2 proj, both in good spots
4. ✅ **Allen vs MIA** - Boom potential (could hit 20+ pts)
5. ⚠️ **Titans D/ST** - Need at least 6 points (turnover opportunities vs Geno)

### Season Outlook 📈
**Current:** 2-3 (8th of 12)
**After Week 6 Win:** 3-3 (playoff probability ~55%)
**After Week 6 Loss:** 2-4 (playoff probability ~10%)

**This is still a MUST-WIN game** despite Thursday's strong start. Protect the lead!

1. **RASHEE RICE RETURNS** - Eligible after Week 6 game vs DET, debuts Oct 19 vs Raiders
2. **Bucky Irving likely back** - Expected return Week 7 or 8

---

## 🎓 KEY LESSONS FROM WEEK 6

### What Worked ✅
1. **Starting Cam Skattebo** - 25 pts vindicated the "volume is king" approach
2. **Dropping Seahawks D/ST** - Avoided another potential disaster
3. **Adding Hassan Haskins** - Addressed RB depth need with Irving out
4. **Streaming defense** - Titans may not be elite, but better than injured Seahawks

### What to Improve 🎯
1. **Prioritize top waiver targets** - Michael Carter (Priority #1) was missed
2. **Act decisively on upgrades** - Packers D/ST still available for Cade Otton swap
3. **Trade timing** - Need to execute Allen trade this week while value high

### Thursday Night Success 🎉
**The Skattebo decision was PERFECT:**
- Predicted: 13.8 points
- Actual: 25.0 points
- Difference: +11.2 points over projection
- Impact: Likely won you the week single-handedly

**This validates the analysis approach:** Volume + opportunity + matchup = fantasy success in PPR leagues.

---

**Record:** 2-3 → Targeting 3-3
**Playoff Chase:** Still alive, must protect Thursday's lead
**Next Milestone:** Rashee Rice returns Week 7 for massive WR boost
