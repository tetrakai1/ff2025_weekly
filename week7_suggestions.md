## FREE AGENTS PRIORITY

### MUST ADD (Before Sunday)

**1. Rams D/ST (LAR) - PRIORITY #1**
- **Projection:** 6.7 vs Raiders (Thursday Night Football)
- **Why:** Elite matchup vs Raiders, play Thursday so get points early
- **Drop:** Titans D/ST (5.9 proj, worse matchup)
- **Action:** Add immediately, starts Thursday 8:15 PM ET

**2. Seahawks D/ST (SEA) - PRIORITY #2**
- **Projection:** 5.9 vs Falcons
- **Why:** Better than Titans, good home matchup
- **Drop:** Titans D/ST if Rams unavailable
- **Action:** Backup option if Rams claimed

**3. Jerry Jeudy (WR, CLE) - WATCH LIST**
- **Projection:** 12.2 points
- **Why:** Depth WR option given MHJ injury
- **Issue:** Already have 7 WRs, not urgent
- **Action:** Monitor only, don't add yet

**4. Tre Tucker (WR, LV) - WATCH LIST**
- **Projection:** 10.9 points
- **Why:** Potential flex depth
- **Action:** Low priority, monitor only

### DROP CANDIDATES (In Order)

1. **Titans D/ST** - Immediate drop for Rams/Seahawks
2. **Cade Otton (TE)** - Backup TE, can stream if needed
3. **Hassan Haskins (RB)** - Limited role in LAC backfield
4. **Hollywood Brown (WR)** - Trade bait, but droppable if needed

**DO NOT DROP:** Rashee Rice (returns!), Bucky Irving (injury healing), MHJ (hold through concussion)

---

## TRADE TARGETS

### Strategy: Leverage WR Depth for RB/TE Upgrade

**Your Trade Assets:**
- 7 WRs on roster (JSN, Rice, McMillan, Allen, MHJ, Mooney, Hollywood)
- Expendable: Keenan Allen (age 33), Hollywood Brown (limited role)
- Rising value: Rashee Rice (just returned)

**Your Roster Needs:**
- Elite RB1 to pair with Dobbins (Irving injury-prone)
- TE upgrade from Engram if available
- Consolidate depth into studs

---

### Specific Trade Proposals

**TRADE #1: Target Torta Pounders (1-5, desperate)**
- **GIVE:** Keenan Allen + Hollywood Brown
- **GET:** Their best RB or WR (identify from their roster)
- **Rationale:** They're 1-5 and desperate, will overpay for depth. Allen has name value, Hollywood has KC pedigree.

**TRADE #2: Target Ryan's Rowdy Team (2-4)**
- **GIVE:** Keenan Allen + Hassan Haskins
- **GET:** Elite TE (Kelce/Kittle tier) or RB1
- **Rationale:** Below .500, need immediate starters. You consolidate for upgrade.

**TRADE #3: Target Auto DraftKings (2-4)**
- **GIVE:** Tetairoa McMillan + Darnell Mooney
- **GET:** Top-10 RB (Bijan Robinson, Kenneth Walker, Breece Hall tier)
- **Rationale:** McMillan has elite 34% target share, Mooney emerging WR2. They get 2 starters, you get RB1.
- **Risk:** Only do if you get TOP-10 RB. McMillan is valuable.

**TRADE #4: 2-for-1 Consolidation (Any Team)**
- **GIVE:** Keenan Allen + Cam Skattebo
- **GET:** Elite WR1 (Amon-Ra, CeeDee, Davante tier)
- **Rationale:** Sell Skattebo after 25pt explosion Week 6. Allen + Skattebo both had peak weeks. Package for stud.

---

### Teams to Target (Based on Standings)

**Desperate (Will Overpay):**
1. Torta Pounders (1-5) - Offer depth for their best player
2. Ryan's Rowdy Team (2-4) - Package deal
3. Auto DraftKings (2-4) - WR depth for RB

**League Injury Landscape:**
- Puka Nacua, Garrett Wilson, Emeka Egbuka, Calvin Ridley all injured around league
- Teams that lost WR1s need replacements - offer Allen/Mooney/Hollywood

---

## Key Decisions

### Rashee Rice: Immediate WR2
- Cleared suspension, immediate role as KC's WR1
- Start over Keenan Allen Week 7
- Allen has better matchup but Rice has higher ceiling
- Andy Reid confident Rice makes "immediate difference"

### Defense Streaming
- **Rams D/ST Thursday night** (Priority #1) - Raiders turnover-prone
- **Seahawks D/ST Sunday** (Backup) - Home vs Falcons
- Drop Titans D/ST immediately

### Flex Decision
- Tetairoa McMillan locked in FLEX (34% target share)
- Backup options: Keenan Allen (if Rice struggles), Bucky Irving (if healthy)

### RB2 Decision
- Cam Skattebo over Hassan Haskins
- Skattebo: 25 pts Week 6, elite volume
- Haskins: Limited role in LAC committee
- Bucky Irving still recovering, keep on bench

---

## Injury Monitor (Check Thursday)

**YOUR ROSTER:**
- **Marvin Harrison Jr.** - Concussion protocol, likely OUT Week 7
- **Bucky Irving** - Foot/shoulder, week-to-week, bench until healthy
