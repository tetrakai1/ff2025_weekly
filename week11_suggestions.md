## Position-by-Position Analysis

### Quarterback: Jordan Love (START)

**Matchup:** @ Giants (23rd-ranked pass defense, 230.9 YPG allowed)
**Multi-Source Projections:**
- ESPN: 17.0 pts
- FantasyPros Rank: QB10 for Week 11
- Expert Consensus: **START**

**Analysis:**
Giants have allowed 26+ fantasy points per game to QBs over last 4 weeks. Six QBs have scored 20+ against them. Love coming off two bad games (7.8 pts vs PHI), but this is a get-right matchup.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (60%) - Favorable matchup, but recent struggles concerning.

**Alternative:** Aaron Rodgers available (18.9 proj @ CIN) if you want to stream higher upside.

---

### Running Backs: Devin Singletary (START), Tyjae Spears (START)

**Singletary @ Packers:**
- Projection: 9.9 pts
- Volume-based floor with limited ceiling
- Best available RB1 option

**Spears vs Texans:**
- Projection: 9.0 pts
- Lead-back touches in Tennessee
- RB2 by default with Dobbins/Irving out

**Injury Impact:**
- J.K. Dobbins OUT (foot injury, potential IR)
- Bucky Irving DOUBTFUL (season-ending)
- RB depth decimated - **URGENT NEED via trade or waivers**

---

### Wide Receivers: Smith-Njigba (START), McMillan (START with caution), Rice (START in FLEX)

**Jaxon Smith-Njigba @ Rams (WR1):**
- ESPN: 22.9 pts | FantasyPros: WR2 overall (13.2 PPR)
- Caught 5-of-6 for 93 yards + TD last week
- Over 1,000 yards on season - clear WR1
- **Confidence:** HIGH (85%)

**Rashee Rice @ Broncos (FLEX - 4:25 PM):**
- ESPN: 16.4 pts
- Faces #19 ranked defense (neutral matchup)
- **Positioned in FLEX for game time flexibility**
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (70%)

**Tetairoa McMillan vs Falcons (WR2):**
- ESPN: 13.5 pts
- **CONCERN:** Faces #3 ranked defense - extremely tough matchup
- Weekly report flagged as HIGH RISK
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM (40%)
- **Alternative:** Keenan Allen (12.1 proj, easier matchup)

**Decision:** Start McMillan for higher ceiling, but monitor closely. If any late injury news, pivot to Keenan Allen.

---

### Tight End: Evan Engram (START)

**Matchup:** vs Chiefs
**Projection:** 8.1 pts
**Analysis:** Consistent target share in Denver offense. Solid TE1 play.
**Confidence:** MEDIUM (60%)

---

### Kicker: Jason Myers (START)

**Projection:** 8.1 pts
**Team:** Seahawks @ Rams (4:05 PM)
**Analysis:** Reliable kicker on high-powered offense. Set-and-forget.

---

### Defense/Special Teams: STREAM FALCONS D/ST

**Current:** Rams D/ST (5.5 proj)
**Recommendation:** **DROP Rams, ADD Falcons D/ST**

**Falcons D/ST vs Panthers - Week 11 Analysis:**

**Opponent Breakdown (Carolina Panthers):**
- **Offensive Rank:** 27th in total yards (297.1 YPG), 28th in scoring (17.7 PPG)
- **Turnover-Prone:** Multiple sacks/turnovers expected
- **Projection:** 6.0 pts (0.5 pt upgrade over Rams)

**Why Falcons:**
1. Panthers offense is bottom-5 in NFL
2. Home game for Atlanta
3. Expert consensus top-5 streaming option
4. Rams face Seahawks (competent offense, lower D/ST upside)

**Other Streaming Options (if Falcons unavailable):**
- Ravens D/ST @ Browns (top option, likely rostered)
- Texans D/ST @ Titans (elite play, likely rostered)
- Chiefs D/ST @ Broncos (solid floor)

**Action:** Drop Rams D/ST, add Falcons D/ST before Sunday 1:00 PM ET.

---

## Waiver Wire Recommendations

### Priority Adds (in order):

**1. Falcons D/ST (vs CAR) - PRIORITY: CRITICAL**
- Projection: 6.0 pts
- **Action:** Drop Rams D/ST, add immediately
- **Rationale:** Streaming upgrade vs bottom-5 offense

**2. Aaron Rodgers (QB, PIT) - PRIORITY: MEDIUM**
- Projection: 18.9 pts (higher than Love's 17.0)
- Matchup: @ Bengals (#13 ranked defense, neutral)
- **Action:** Consider if you want QB upside over Love
- **Drop Candidate:** Isaiah Davis (RB, 7.3 proj - minimal value)
- **Rationale:** Rodgers has higher ceiling this week if you need boom potential

**3. Jameson Williams (WR, DET) - PRIORITY: LOW-MEDIUM**
- Projection: 11.9 pts
- Matchup: @ Eagles (SNF)
- **Action:** Monitor, but not urgent with current WR depth
- **Rationale:** Boom/bust option, Lions offense clicking

### DO NOT ADD:
- **Chuba Hubbard (RB, CAR):** Only 5.2 proj, Panthers offense struggles
- **Cooper Kupp (WR, SEA):** Only 6.3 proj - likely injured or limited role
- **Joe Mixon (RB, HOU):** 0.0 proj - injured/unavailable

2. If rejected, send to Torta Pounders: Allen + Mooney for CeeDee Lamb
3. Backup: Send to Moms rules: Allen + McMillan for Jalen Hurts

**Trade Message Template:**
```
Hey [Team Name],

Wanted to reach out before the deadline. I'm looking to consolidate my WR depth, and I think this could help both of us:

I send: Keenan Allen (12.1 PPR/week) + Darnell Mooney (9.3 PPR/week)
You send: [Justin Jefferson / CeeDee Lamb]

Both are healthy, Allen just broke Chargers' all-time reception record. Combined 21.4 pts/week gives you two starters for one. Helps with your [WR injuries / depth needs].

Let me know if you're interested or want to counter!
```

## Matchup Analysis

**Opponent:** Ryan's Rowdy Team (6-4, #3 standing)

**Their Projected Lineup:**
- Josh Allen (QB): 20.8 pts - **Their best player**
- Ashton Jeanty (RB): 18.8 pts
- Javonte Williams (RB): 16.1 pts

**Their Weaknesses:**
- 7 injured players (Ladd McConkey, D'Andre Swift, Travis Hunter, Bills/Lions D/ST, Brenton Strange, Justice Hill)
- Defense positions both injured
- Could be vulnerable if QB/RB production falters

**Your Path to Victory:**
1. **Boom from Smith-Njigba:** Need 25+ pts from JSN (possible, FP ranks him WR2)
2. **Jordan Love bounces back:** Get-right matchup vs Giants, need 20+ pts
3. **Opponent bust:** Josh Allen has tough matchup vs Tampa, could underperform
4. **Defense wins:** Stream Falcons D/ST, hope for 8-10 pts with turnovers

**Win Probability:** 25% (need multiple things to go right)
