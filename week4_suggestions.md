## üìä Position-by-Position Analysis

### QUARTERBACK

#### **STARTER: Jordan Love (GB)**
- **Projection:** 18.6 points vs Dallas
- **Analysis:** Facing Dallas' 17th-ranked pass defense in a neutral matchup. Love has been consistent when healthy. Green Bay at home typically performs well. Dallas defense has been beatable through the air.
- **Week 4 Edge:** Home advantage at Lambeau, primetime game likelihood
- **Alternative:** Consider streaming Tua Tagovailoa (15.6 proj) if available

### RUNNING BACKS

#### **RB1: Bucky Irving (TB)** 
- **Projection:** 17.5 points @ Philadelphia
- **Analysis:** ELITE PLAY - Irving has taken over the Tampa backfield from Rachaad White. Ranked RB9 for Week 4. Philadelphia has been vulnerable to pass-catching backs. Irving's PPR value through receiving work provides safe floor.
- **Verdict:** LOCKED IN - Must start every week

#### **RB2: J.K. Dobbins (DEN)**
- **Projection:** 16.1 points vs Cincinnati  
- **Analysis:** SMASH SPOT - Cincinnati allows 2nd-most fantasy points to RBs without Joe Burrow. Dobbins has 71% snap share, clear RB1 role. Denver favored by 7 at home = positive game script. Averaging 5.4 YPC through 3 weeks.
- **Verdict:** MUST START - Elite matchup, locked-in volume

#### **Bench RB:**
- **Cam Skattebo (NYG):** 14.1 proj - Keep as bye week fill-in

### WIDE RECEIVERS

#### **WR1: Marvin Harrison Jr. (ARI)**  
- **Projection:** 12.7 points @ Seattle
- **Analysis:** Buy-low window closing. Elite target share despite drops. Thursday night game provides extra rest. Seattle plays zone (MHJ struggled vs zone at 9% win rate) but talent wins out. Red zone looks continue.
- **Verdict:** START - Talent over tough matchup

#### **WR2: Keenan Allen (LAC)**
- **Projection:** 13.4 points vs NYG
- **Analysis:** Herbert's red-zone favorite at age 33. Giants defense ranks bottom-10. Home game advantage. This could be peak trade value after strong performances.
- **Verdict:** START over JSN - Better matchup this week

#### **FLEX: Darnell Mooney (ATL)**
- **Projection:** 10.6 points @ Washington
- **Analysis:** Emerged as Falcons WR2 behind London. Washington's pass defense is exploitable. Road game but Falcons offense clicking. Consistent target share last 2 weeks.
- **Verdict:** FLEX PLAY - Volume-based floor

#### **Critical Bench Decisions:**
- **Jaxon Smith-Njigba:** BENCH despite 16.4 projection - Faces #1 Arizona defense
- **Tetairoa McMillan:** BENCH - Questionable tag + tough matchup
- **Hollywood Brown:** HOLD - Trade bait, limited KC role
- **RASHEE RICE:** SUSPENDED - Returns Week 7, DO NOT DROP

### TIGHT END

#### **STARTER: Cade Otton (TB)**
- **Projection:** 7.2 points @ Philadelphia
- **Analysis:** Safe floor with Evans potentially limited. If Engram (questionable) is cleared by Sunday, pivot to him for upside. Otton provides consistent 5-7 points.
- **Decision Point:** Check Engram status Sunday morning
- **Verdict:** START unless Engram fully healthy

### KICKER & DEFENSE

#### **Jake Elliott (PHI):** 8.3 proj - Set and forget
#### **Texans D/ST:** 7.2 proj - Tennessee struggling, good streaming play

## üîÑ Week 4 Roster Moves

### IMMEDIATE WAIVER CLAIMS (by priority):

1. **James Conner (RB, ARI)** - If available
   - Reports of season-ending injury may be false
   - Worth speculative add given your RB depth
   - Drop: Cam Skattebo

2. **Joe Burrow (QB, CIN)** - Backup QB
   - Better than streaming options
   - Potential Love insurance
   - Drop: Matthew Golden

3. **Jerry Jeudy (WR, CLE)** - 11.3 proj
   - Buy-low after tough stretch
   - Better than Golden long-term
   - Drop: Matthew Golden

### DROP CANDIDATES:
1. **Matthew Golden** - Lowest upside on roster
2. **Cam Skattebo** - If better RB available
3. **DO NOT DROP:** Rashee Rice (returns Week 7)

## üí∞ Trade Strategy for Week 4

### SELL HIGH (This Week):
1. **Keenan Allen** 
   - Peak value at age 33
   - Package with bench WR for WR1
   - Target: Davante Adams, Mike Evans types

2. **Hollywood Brown**
   - Limited KC role
   - Name value exceeds production
   - Package deal candidate

### BUY LOW TARGETS:
1. **Tetairoa McMillan** (if not owned)
   - 34% target share is elite
   - TD regression coming
   
2. **Chris Olave**
   - Huge upside, depressed value
   
3. **Ashton Jeanty**
   - Breakout imminent, great schedule

### SUGGESTED TRADE PACKAGE:
- **GIVE:** Keenan Allen + Hollywood Brown

## üéÆ Matchup Strategy

### vs Auto DraftKings (1-2 record)
**Their Threats:**
- Caleb Williams (QB): 19.6 proj
- Jonathan Taylor (RB): 18.9 proj  
- Justin Jefferson (WR): 16.7 proj

**Your Path to Victory:**
- Need Irving & Dobbins to hit ceiling (both have elite matchups)
- Hope for Jefferson to underperform
- Win the FLEX battle (Mooney vs their FLEX)

**Projected Outcome:**
- You: 111.5 (with my lineup)
- Opponent: 122.4
- **Still 11-point underdog but narrowed gap**
