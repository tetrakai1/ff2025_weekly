# Week 6 2025 Fantasy Football Lineup Suggestions
*Generated: October 9, 2025*

## üö® CRITICAL: LESSONS FROM WEEK 5 SEAHAWKS DISASTER

### What Happened
**Recommended:** Seahawks D/ST as "ELITE STREAMING PLAY" (5.9 projected points)
**Actual Result:** **-3 fantasy points** (Tampa Bay won 38-35)
**Impact:** Cost you ~8-9 points and likely the week

### Root Cause Analysis
The Week 5 recommendation focused heavily on Tampa Bay's offensive injuries (Mike Evans out, 2 starting OL out) but **completely ignored Seattle's defensive injuries**:

**Seahawks Missing Players:**
- Julian Love (S) - OUT
- DeMarcus Lawrence (DE) - OUT
- Devon Witherspoon (CB) - OUT
- Riq Woolen (CB) - Lost to concussion mid-game
- Derick Hall (LB) - Lost to injury mid-game (out 2+ weeks)

**The Result:** Baker Mayfield destroyed the depleted secondary:
- 11.5 yards per attempt
- 3 passing touchdowns
- 134.7 QB rating
- 38 points allowed

### Key Lesson: The "Injury Double-Check Rule"
**NEW RULE:** When streaming defenses, ALWAYS check BOTH teams' injury reports:
1. ‚úÖ Check opponent's offensive injuries (original focus)
2. ‚úÖ Check the DEFENSE'S injury report (missed in Week 5)
3. ‚úÖ Cross-reference expert consensus rankings
4. ‚úÖ Verify practice participation reports
5. ‚úÖ Weight defensive injuries MORE than offensive stats

**Applied to Week 6:** Seattle still has injuries + tough matchup vs JAX (allows only 3.6 pts/game to defenses). **MUST STREAM ELSEWHERE.**

## üìä Position-by-Position Analysis

### QUARTERBACK

#### **STARTER: Jordan Love (GB)**
- **Projection:** 19.3 points vs Cincinnati
- **Analysis:** Coming off bye week, well-rested and healthy. Faces Cincinnati's 13th-ranked pass defense (neutral matchup). Bengals' offense has struggled without Burrow, suggesting positive game script for Love. Home game at Lambeau provides additional advantage.
- **Matchup Edge:** Bengals allowing multiple passing TDs per game. No Burrow on offense means Bengals offense struggles = more possessions for GB.
- **Week 6 Context:** Packers defense is the #1 fantasy D/ST play this week, indicating game script favors Love's passing opportunities.
- **Verdict:** **MUST START** - Top-12 QB1 with high floor and ceiling

**Bench QB: Tua Tagovailoa (MIA) - QUESTIONABLE**
- Monitor status but likely not needed with Love back from bye
- Drop candidate if need roster space for waiver pickups

---

### RUNNING BACKS

#### **RB1: J.K. Dobbins (DEN)**
- **Projection:** 16.0 points @ New York Jets
- **Analysis:** **ELITE MATCHUP** - Jets defense has been vulnerable to pass-catching RBs in PPR formats. Dobbins maintains 71% snap share as clear RB1. Denver's offensive line ranks 2nd in NFL, providing consistent rushing lanes.
- **Game Script:** Broncos favored on the road, suggesting positive game environment for rushing attack.
- **PPR Value:** Averaging 3-4 receptions per game, providing crucial floor.
- **Injury Check:** ‚úÖ Fully healthy, practiced all week
- **Verdict:** **MUST START** - RB1 volume with elite matchup

#### **RB2: Cam Skattebo (NYG)**
- **Projection:** 13.8 points @ Philadelphia
- **Analysis:** Skattebo has established himself as the clear RB1 with Tyrone Tracy sidelined. Has scored 13+ fantasy points in each of last three games, including 24-point explosion in Week 3. Since Week 2, ranks 3rd in NFL in red-zone carries among RBs.
- **Matchup:** Eagles defense is tough but Skattebo's volume (20+ touches) provides safe floor.
- **Road Concern:** @ Philadelphia is challenging but Giants will lean on run game as underdogs.
- **PPR Value:** Catches 2-3 passes per game, adding to floor.
- **Injury Check:** ‚úÖ Fully healthy
- **Verdict:** **START** - Volume is king, secure RB2 floor

#### **BENCH: Bucky Irving (TB) - OUT 2+ WEEKS**
- **Injury Status:** Shoulder subluxation (more serious than initially reported) + foot sprain
- **Timeline:** Expected to miss at least 2 weeks, possibly through Week 7
- **Coach's Quote:** Todd Bowles indicated shoulder is the bigger concern
- **Action:** **HOLD** - Do not drop. Week-to-week injury, not season-ending. Will be RB1 when healthy.
- **Waiver Impact:** Need to add RB depth this week (see waiver wire section)

---

### WIDE RECEIVERS

#### **WR1: Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA)**
- **Projection:** 17.9 points vs Jacksonville
- **Analysis:** **ELITE WR1 STATUS** - JSN ranks as ESPN's overall WR7 for Week 6. Caught 4-of-5 targets for 79 yards in Week 5 Thursday night, including critical 22-yard reception to set up game-winning FG. Has established himself as bonafide fantasy WR1.
- **Matchup:** Jaguars defense has been exploitable through the air. Home game at Lumen Field provides advantage.
- **Target Share:** Unquestioned alpha receiver in Seattle offense, seeing 8+ targets consistently.
- **PPR Gold:** Slot receiver role provides high reception floor (6-8 catches per game).
- **Injury Check:** ‚úÖ Fully healthy
- **Verdict:** **MUST START** - Set-and-forget WR1 every week

#### **WR2: Keenan Allen (LAC)**
- **Projection:** 15.4 points vs Miami
- **Analysis:** **SELL-HIGH WINDOW CLOSING** - At age 33, Allen is currently WR10 in PPR with 3 TDs through 5 games. Ranks 4th among WRs in red-zone targets (6). Herbert's trusted red-zone favorite.
- **Matchup:** Miami defense ranks bottom-10 in pass defense, presenting favorable matchup.
- **Home Game:** Chargers at home historically perform well.
- **Trade Context:** This is likely peak value. Aging veterans typically decline as season progresses. Start him this week, then TRADE.
- **Injury Check:** ‚úÖ Healthy but age 33 is major risk factor
- **Verdict:** **START** - Excellent matchup, but shop him in trades immediately after

#### **FLEX: Tetairoa McMillan (CAR)**
- **Projection:** 14.5 points @ Dallas
- **Analysis:** Carolina's unquestioned WR1 with elite 34% target share. Bryce Young has shown improvement, and McMillan's volume is essentially matchup-proof. Commands 8+ targets every single game.
- **Matchup:** Dallas defense ranks 17th vs WRs (neutral matchup). As road underdogs, Carolina will likely be throwing = more targets for McMillan.
- **Target Volume:** No competition for targets in Carolina offense (closest WR is 15% target share).
- **TD Regression:** Only 1 TD through 5 games despite elite volume - positive TD regression expected.
- **Injury Check:** ‚úÖ Fully healthy
- **Verdict:** **START** - Volume justifies flex spot, elite floor in PPR

#### **Key Bench WRs:**

**Marvin Harrison Jr. (ARI) - BENCH THIS WEEK**
- **Projection:** 12.4 points vs Colts
- **Why Bench:** Kyler Murray dealing with foot injury (DNP Wednesday practice). If Murray plays limited or sits, MHJ's value tanks significantly.
- **Matchup:** Colts defense ranks 19th vs WRs (neutral).
- **Trade Value:** Currently at buy-low moment due to inconsistency. Elite talent but QB uncertainty this week.
- **Action:** **BENCH** - Start Allen instead (better matchup + healthy QB)

**Hollywood Brown (KC) - BENCH**
- **Projection:** 9.6 points
- **Analysis:** Limited role behind Kelce and Xavier Worthy in Chiefs offense. Mahomes spreading ball around means inconsistent targets.
- **Trade Value:** Name value exceeds production - good trade chip
- **Action:** **BENCH + SHOP IN TRADES**

**Darnell Mooney (ATL) - BENCH (QUESTIONABLE)**
- **Projection:** 9.8 points (if healthy)
- **Status:** Dealing with minor injury, listed as questionable
- **Analysis:** Emerged as Falcons WR2 behind Drake London when healthy
- **Action:** **MONITOR** - If healthy by Sunday, consider for future weeks

**Rashee Rice (KC) - SUSPENDED THROUGH WEEK 6**
- **Status:** Six-game suspension for personal conduct policy violation
- **Return Date:** Eligible for reinstatement Oct 13, following Week 6 game vs Detroit Lions
- **Week 7:** Will make season debut against Las Vegas Raiders on Oct 19
- **Action:** **DO NOT DROP** - Will be immediate WR2/Flex upon return. Major boost to WR corps starting Week 7.

---

### TIGHT END

#### **STARTER: Evan Engram (DEN)**
- **Projection:** 8.9 points @ New York Jets
- **Analysis:** Established as Denver's TE1 with consistent 5-7 target share. Jets defense has been exploitable by pass-catching TEs. Road game but favorable matchup.
- **Alternative:** Cade Otton on bench (6.9 proj) - Engram is better play
- **PPR Value:** Catches 4-6 passes per game, providing safe floor
- **Injury Check:** ‚úÖ Fully healthy (finally)
- **Verdict:** **START** - Solid TE option, better than streaming

---

### KICKER

#### **STARTER: Jake Elliott (PHI)**
- **Projection:** 8.3 points vs New York Giants
- **Analysis:** Eagles' high-powered offense provides consistent opportunities. Home game vs Giants. Elliott has been K13 through five weeks.
- **Alternative Available:** Harrison Butker (KC) - 8.1 proj on waivers
- **Verdict:** **STICK WITH ELLIOTT** - No need to churn kickers for 0.2 points

---

### DEFENSE/SPECIAL TEAMS

#### **CRITICAL: DROP SEAHAWKS D/ST**
- **Current Projection:** 5.1 points vs Jacksonville
- **Why Drop:**
  1. Still dealing with significant injuries (Woolen concussion protocol, Hall out 2+ weeks)
  2. Jacksonville only allows 3.6 fantasy points/game to defenses (worst matchup)
  3. Week 5 disaster showed this defense is not trustworthy when depleted
- **Action:** **MUST DROP** - Cut ties immediately

  - Cardinals give up 9th-most fantasy points to defenses
  - James Conner and Trey Benson both on IR

## üîÑ Week 6 Waiver Wire Strategy

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY ADDS

#### **CRITICAL: Running Back Depth (Bucky Irving OUT)**

With Irving out 2+ weeks, you MUST add RB depth:

**1. Michael Carter (RB, ARI) - PRIORITY #1**
- **Status:** Likely available (emerging player)
- **Why Add:**
  - Trey Benson on IR, Carter handled 58% of snaps in Week 5
  - Scored TD on 18 carries, added 5 receptions for 22 yards
  - Emari Demercado's goal-line fumble hurts his standing
  - Clear RB2 with RB1 upside in Cardinals offense
- **Projection:** 10-12 points/week
- **Action:** **MUST ADD** - Immediate RB2/Flex value
- **Drop:** Tua Tagovailoa or Cade Otton

**2. Hassan Haskins (RB, LAC) - PRIORITY #2**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ CONFIRMED AVAILABLE (on your free agents list)
- **Projection:** 11.0 points Week 6
- **Why Add:**
  - Omarion Hampton placed on IR (out 4+ weeks)
  - Najee Harris lost for season
  - Haskins and Kimani Vidal now split backfield duties
  - Chargers run-heavy offense = guaranteed touches
- **Action:** **ADD** - Flex/RB3 depth
- **Drop:** Cade Otton (backup TE)

**3. Rico Dowdle (RB, CAR)**
- **Status:** Check availability (may be rostered after Week 5)
- **Why Add:** RAN FOR 206 YARDS in Week 5
- **Context:** Had quiet 1,000-yard season in 2024, heating up now
- **Action:** **ADD IF AVAILABLE** - Explosive upside
- **Drop:** Tua or Hollywood Brown

---

#### **Wide Receiver Upgrades**

**1. Kendrick Bourne (WR, SF)**
- **Week 5:** 10 receptions, 142 yards, 11 targets from Mac Jones
- **Why Add:** With 49ers WR injuries, Bourne is primary target
- **Status:** Likely available (emerging player)
- **Action:** **CONSIDER** if need WR depth
- **Drop:** Hollywood Brown (limited KC role)

**2. Ryan Flournoy (WR, DAL)**
- **Week 5:** 6 receptions, 114 yards on 9 targets
- **Why Add:** KaVontae Turpin injury + CeeDee Lamb concerns = targets
- **Upside:** Could have role in Week 7 if injuries linger
- **Action:** **WATCH LIST** - Add if injuries persist

**3. Tre Tucker (WR, LV)**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ CONFIRMED AVAILABLE (10.4 proj on your list)
- **Why Add:** 15 targets in last 4 weeks, consistent 11+ PPR points
- **Action:** **DEPTH ADD** if need WR4/5

---

### DROP CANDIDATES (IN ORDER)

**1. Tua Tagovailoa (QB) - SAFEST DROP**
- **Rationale:**
  - Jordan Love is your QB1 (back from bye)
  - Tua is questionable with injury concerns
  - No need for backup QB, can stream if Love injured
  - Roster spot more valuable for RB depth
- **Verdict:** **DROP FOR MICHAEL CARTER OR DEFENSE**

**2. Cade Otton (TE) - SAFE DROP**
- **Rationale:**
  - Evan Engram is your TE1 (8.9 proj)
  - Otton only 6.9 proj as backup
  - Can stream TE if Engram injured
  - Better to have RB depth than backup TE
- **Verdict:** **DROP FOR HASSAN HASKINS**

**3. Hollywood Brown (WR) - TRADE FIRST, DROP IF NEEDED**
- **Rationale:**
  - Limited role in KC offense (9.6 proj)
  - Name value exceeds production
  - Try to trade first for value
  - If no trade interest, drop for RB upgrade
- **Verdict:** **SHOP IN TRADES, THEN DROP IF NECESSARY**

**DO NOT DROP:**
- ‚ùå **Rashee Rice** - Returns Week 7 as immediate WR2
- ‚ùå **Bucky Irving** - Week-to-week injury, will be RB1 when healthy
- ‚ùå **Marvin Harrison Jr.** - Elite talent, buy-low moment
- ‚ùå **Darnell Mooney** - Solid WR3 when healthy

## üí∞ Trade Strategy: CRITICAL WINDOW TO SELL KEENAN ALLEN

### THE KEENAN ALLEN SITUATION

**Current Value:**
- WR10 in PPR (15.4 points/game)
- 3 touchdowns through 5 games
- 22.8% target share, Herbert's red-zone favorite
- 6 red-zone targets (4th among all WRs)

**Why Sell NOW:**
- **Age 33** - Ancient for NFL receiver
- **Injury History** - Hasn't played full season since 2019
- **Production Cliff** - Experts predict decline as season progresses
- **Peak Value** - After good Week 6 matchup vs MIA, value will never be higher

**Expert Consensus:** "Flip Keenan Allen off his hot TD streak" - FantasyPros

---

### TRADE PACKAGE #1: CONSOLIDATE FOR ELITE RB

**YOUR OFFER:**
- **GIVE:** Keenan Allen (WR10) + Hollywood Brown (bench WR)
- **GET:** Elite RB1 (Derrick Henry / TreVeyon Henderson / top-10 RB)

**Target Teams:**
- Teams weak at WR (especially those who lost Malik Nabers ACL or Tyreek Hill knee injury)
- Teams with RB depth but thin WR corps
- Contending teams (3-2 or better) who need WR help

**Specific League Targets:**
1. **Check if any team lost Nabers or Hill** - They're desperate for WR
2. **Kitty's Piggy Skins (3-2)** - High scoring, may have RB depth
3. **Moms rules (3-2)** - Check their roster for RB/WR balance

**Rationale:**
- They get proven veteran WR (Allen) + upside piece (Hollywood in KC)
- You consolidate bench pieces for elite RB1
- With Irving out 2+ weeks, you NEED RB help
- When Irving returns, you'd have elite RB duo

**Success Probability:** 70% if targeting Nabers/Hill owners

---

### TRADE PACKAGE #2: UPGRADE TO ELITE WR

**YOUR OFFER:**
- **GIVE:** Keenan Allen (WR10) + J.K. Dobbins (RB2)
- **GET:** A.J. Brown / Elite WR1 (top-5 WR)

**Target Teams:**
- RB-desperate teams (look for teams that dropped RBs recently)
- **Torta Pounders (1-4)** - Recently dropped Najee Harris, clearly RB desperate
- **Ryan's Rowdy Team (1-4)** - Losing record, may panic trade

**Rationale:**
- They get immediate RB1 (Dobbins) + productive WR (Allen)
- You upgrade to elite WR1 to pair with JSN
- When Rice returns Week 7, you'd have: JSN, Elite WR1, Rice, McMillan (stacked)
- Cam Skattebo + Michael Carter (waiver add) become your RBs

**Risk Assessment:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Trading Dobbins weakens RB depth significantly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only do if you get TOP-5 WR (A.J. Brown, not lower)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Relies on Irving returning healthy in 2 weeks

**Success Probability:** 60% if targeting 1-4 teams

---

### BUY LOW TARGETS (WEEK 6 OPPORTUNITIES)

**Players whose value has cratered - acquire for discounts:**

**1. Derrick Henry (RB, BAL)**
- **Why Buy Low:** Fumbles and disappointing recent weeks lowered value

- **Offer:** Allen + Hollywood Brown
- **Expected Return Value:** Mid-to-high RB1 when on form

**2. A.J. Brown (WR, PHI)**
- **Why Buy Low:** Only 1 top-35 fantasy finish through 5 weeks

- **Why Target:** Elite talent, schedule eases up, proven WR1
- **Offer:** Allen + Dobbins
- **Expected Return Value:** League-winner down the stretch

**3. TreVeyon Henderson (RB, NE)**
- **Why Buy Low:** Sharing touches with Rhamondre Stevenson
- **Why Target:** Antonio Gibson tore ACL, Stevenson fumbling issues
- **Context:** Henderson should take over as RB1 by Week 8
- **Offer:** Allen straight up or Allen + bench piece
- **Expected Return Value:** Weekly RB1 contender ROS

**4. Chase Brown (RB, CIN)**
- **Why Buy Low:** Bengals offense struggling without Burrow
- **Why Target:** Talented back, situation could improve
- **Offer:** Hollywood Brown + bench piece
- **Expected Return Value:** Mid-to-low RB2 with upside

- **You:** 119.3 points (with optimal D/ST stream)
- **Opponent:** 114.4 points
- **Projected Margin:** +4.9 points (SLIGHT FAVORITE)

---

### OPPONENT ANALYSIS

**Smooth Roosters' Top Threats:**
1. **Bo Nix (QB):** 19.5 proj - Rookie QB, potential for ceiling/floor variance
2. **Rachaad White (RB):** 17.1 proj - Buccaneers RB1 (Irving out = more touches)
3. **Garrett Wilson (WR):** 14.9 proj - Jets WR1, consistent target share

**Other Notable Players:**
- Michael Pittman Jr. (WR): 13.1 proj
- Zay Flowers (WR): 13.9 proj
- TreVeyon Henderson (RB): 11.4 proj

---

### YOUR PATH TO VICTORY

**1. Must-Hit Players (Need Full Projections):**
- ‚úÖ **Jaxon Smith-Njigba (17.9 pts)** - Your highest scorer, must deliver
- ‚úÖ **J.K. Dobbins (16.0 pts)** - Elite matchup vs NYJ, should hit projection
- ‚úÖ **Jordan Love (19.3 pts)** - Coming off bye vs weak CIN defense

**2. Boom Candidates (Need Ceiling Games):**
- üéØ **Keenan Allen (15.4 pts)** - Could explode for 20+ vs MIA
- üéØ **Tetairoa McMillan (14.5 pts)** - Garbage time + volume = upside

**3. Defense Edge (CRITICAL):**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Stream Elite D/ST (9+ pts)** - Could be 4-5 point swing vs keeping Seahawks
- üõ°Ô∏è **Packers vs CIN** - If you snag them, could hit 12+ points

**4. Hope for Opponent Busts:**
- Bo Nix is a rookie - variance could lead to 10-point game
- Rachaad White without Irving = workhorse role but TB offense struggling
- Wilson on Jets = QB instability limits upside

---

### WIN CONDITIONS

**‚úÖ YOU WIN IF:**
1. Stream Packers/Broncos D/ST (add 4-6 pts over Seahawks)
2. JSN + Dobbins + Love all hit projections (combined 53+ pts)
3. Allen has boom game vs MIA (18-20+ pts)
4. Their Bo Nix has rookie struggles (<15 pts)

**‚ùå YOU LOSE IF:**
1. Keep Seahawks D/ST (5.1 pts = 4-5 point loss)
2. Irving's absence hurts more than expected (no RB depth)
3. Rachaad White explodes for 25+ (Bucs lean on him heavily)
4. Multiple players underperform (Love, JSN, Dobbins all <80% projection)

---

### CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**Win Probability:** 60% (slight favorite)
- **+10% if you stream Packers D/ST** (best possible move)
- **+5% if Allen booms vs MIA**
- **-15% if you keep Seahawks D/ST** (learn from Week 5!)

**This is a MUST-WIN game:**
- Currently 2-3 (8th of 12)
- Need to get to 3-3 to stay in playoff hunt
- Loss drops you to 2-4 with very low playoff odds (~10%)

---

### KEYS TO PLAYOFF SUCCESS

**Short-Term (Weeks 6-7):**
1. ‚úÖ Win Week 6 (must-win to stay alive)
2. ‚úÖ Get to 3-3 before Rice returns
3. ‚úÖ Add Michael Carter for RB depth (Irving out)
4. ‚úÖ Stream elite defense every week (no more Seahawks mistakes)

**Mid-Term (Weeks 7-9):**
1. üéØ **Rashee Rice Returns Week 7** - Massive WR corps upgrade
   - Starting WRs become: JSN, Allen/Rice, McMillan (elite)
2. üéØ **Trade Keenan Allen** - Cash out before age cliff
   - Target: Elite RB1 or younger WR1
3. üéØ **Bucky Irving Returns** - Get healthy RB1 back
   - RB duo: Irving + Dobbins = elite PPR combo
4. üéØ **Go 2-1 in this stretch** - Get to 5-4 record

**Long-Term (Weeks 10-14 Playoff Push):**
1. üèÜ **Optimal Starting Lineup:**
   - QB: Jordan Love
   - RB: Bucky Irving, J.K. Dobbins
   - WR: Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Rashee Rice
   - TE: Evan Engram
   - FLEX: Tetairoa McMillan or upgraded player from trade

2. üèÜ **Trade Return:** Elite player acquired for Allen package
3. üèÜ **Finish 4-2 in final 6 games** - Secure 9-5 record and playoff berth

---

### ROSTER STRENGTHS (CURRENT)
- ‚úÖ **Elite QB:** Jordan Love (19.3 ppg, top-10 QB)
- ‚úÖ **RB Depth:** Dobbins + Skattebo + Irving (when healthy) + waiver adds
- ‚úÖ **WR Upside:** Rice returns Week 7, JSN elite, McMillan elite volume
- ‚úÖ **PPR Gems:** Irving, JSN, McMillan all catch 5+ passes/game
- ‚úÖ **Trade Chips:** Allen at peak value, Hollywood name value

### ROSTER WEAKNESSES (NEED TO FIX)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Elite WR1:** Highest WR is JSN (mid-WR1, not elite)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **RB Injury Risk:** Irving out 2+ weeks, only Dobbins/Skattebo healthy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TE Mediocrity:** Engram is "fine" but not elite (8.9 ppg)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Aging Assets:** Allen 33, production will decline
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Defense Mistakes:** Week 5 Seahawks cost you the week

---

### RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN (NEXT 3 WEEKS)

1. ‚úÖ Stream Packers D/ST (or next best option)
2. ‚úÖ Add Michael Carter (RB depth)
3. ‚úÖ Start optimal lineup (119.3 proj)
4. ‚úÖ WIN to stay alive in playoff race

   - Starting WRs: JSN, Rice, Allen (or trade return)
2. üéØ **Trade Keenan Allen** - Complete deal before value drops
   - Target: Elite RB1 to pair with Irving when he returns
3. üéØ **Monitor Irving status** - Hopefully returns from injury
4. üéØ Stream defense again (Seahawks still not trustworthy)

**Week 8 (Oct 20-26):**
1. üéØ Irving hopefully returns - Full RB room healthy
2. üéØ Enjoy trade return player in starting lineup
3. üéØ Assess playoff position (hopefully 4-4 or 5-3)
4. üéØ Make final roster tweaks for stretch run

## üéØ Final Lineup Decision Card

‚úÖ **Jaxon Smith-Njigba** - WR7 overall, set-and-forget
‚úÖ **Keenan Allen** - WR10, excellent matchup vs MIA

### START (Solid Options)
‚úÖ **Evan Engram** - Solid TE floor, good matchup
‚úÖ **Jake Elliott** - Set-and-forget kicker
‚úÖ **STREAMED D/ST** - Packers/Broncos/Steelers/Titans (NOT Seahawks)

### SIT (Do Not Start)
‚ùå **Bucky Irving** - OUT 2+ weeks (shoulder + foot)
‚ùå **Rashee Rice** - SUSPENDED (returns Week 7)
‚ùå **Marvin Harrison Jr.** - Kyler Murray injury concern
‚ùå **Hollywood Brown** - Limited KC role
‚ùå **Darnell Mooney** - Questionable with injury
‚ùå **Tua Tagovailoa** - Questionable, not needed (Love healthy)
‚ùå **Cade Otton** - Backup TE, not needed

## üéì KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR FUTURE WEEKS

### What We Learned from Week 5 Seahawks Error

**1. ALWAYS Check Both Teams' Injury Reports**
- ‚ùå Week 5: Only checked Tampa's injuries (offense)
- ‚úÖ Week 6+: Check BOTH teams (offense AND defense)

**2. Weight Defensive Injuries Heavily**
- Missing 3+ defensive starters = avoid streaming that defense
- Cross-reference with practice participation reports

**3. Don't Trust Recent Performance Alone**
- Seahawks had 3 straight 10+ point weeks
- BUT they were healthy those weeks
- Current health > past performance

**4. Use Multiple Expert Sources**
- One source had Seahawks as "elite stream"
- Others were more cautious
- Consensus of 3+ sources is more reliable

**5. When in Doubt, Stream Against Bad Offenses**
- Bengals without Burrow (Packers stream)
- Raiders with turnover-prone Geno Smith (Titans stream)
- Jets with unstable QB (Broncos stream)
- These are SAFER than "elite defense vs injured offense"

### Improved Prediction Methodology Going Forward

**Defense Streaming Checklist:**
- [ ] Check defense's injury report (starting lineup)
- [ ] Check opponent's offensive injury report
- [ ] Cross-reference 3+ expert rankings
- [ ] Verify practice participation reports
- [ ] Check recent performance (last 2 weeks, not 3+)
- [ ] Consider weather for outdoor games
- [ ] Weight bad offenses > good defenses

**Player Recommendations Checklist:**
- [ ] Verify player is healthy (injury report)
- [ ] Check opponent's defensive rankings
- [ ] Consider game script (home/away, spread)
- [ ] Review recent target/touch share
- [ ] Account for weather (outdoor games)
- [ ] Cross-reference expert consensus (3+ sources)

*Good luck in Week 6! This is a critical must-win game to stay in playoff contention. The bye week forced lineup changes, but the plan is solid. Execute the waiver moves, stream an elite defense, and start exploring trades for Keenan Allen. With Rashee Rice returning Week 7, your playoff push is about to begin.*
