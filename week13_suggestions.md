# Week 13 Fantasy Football Analysis - Valued Customers

**Week 13 | November 27 - December 1, 2025**
**Opponent:** 4th and pinches (8-4)
**Current Record:** 6-6 (5th place)

## Executive Summary

**Win Probability: 80.5%** | **Expected Margin: +28.0 pts**

This is a pivotal Week 13 matchup against a division leader. We have significant projected advantages at QB (Brissett vs potentially injured Mayfield), WR (JSN elite, Rice vs DAL), and overall team depth. The boom/bust analysis using the new opportunity metrics and Vegas props shows strong upside potential for our key players.

**Key Storylines:**
- **Rashee Rice** faces the worst defense vs WRs (Dallas allows 18 TDs to WRs this season)
- **Jaxon Smith-Njigba** continues historic pace (1,313 yds, on track for 2,030)
- **Bucky Irving** returns from 7-game absence with excellent matchup vs ARI run defense
- **Marvin Harrison Jr.** questionable (appendicitis surgery Nov 10)

### Their Advantages:
1. **RB:** Jahmyr Gibbs elite in PPR
2. **TE:** Trey McBride consistent production
