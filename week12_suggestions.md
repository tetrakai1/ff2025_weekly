## Recommended Starting Lineup

| Position | Player | Team | Opponent | Game Time | Projection | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **QB** | Jordan Love | GB | vs MIN | Sun 1:00 PM | 17.4 | Strong matchup vs Vikings |
| **RB1** | Emanuel Wilson | GB | vs MIN | Sun 1:00 PM | 14.5 | Starting role with Josh Jacobs injured |
| **RB2** | Devin Singletary | NYG | @ DET | Sun 1:00 PM | 8.0 | Volume play, established role |
| **WR1** | Jaxon Smith-Njigba | SEA | vs TEN | Sun 4:05 PM | 21.3 | WR1 target share, excellent matchup |
| **WR2** | Rashee Rice | KC | vs IND | Sun 4:25 PM | 17.7 | High-upside PPR weapon |
| **TE** | Juwan Johnson | NO | @ ATL | Sun 1:00 PM | 9.2 | Consistent red zone target |
| **FLEX** | Tetairoa McMillan | CAR | @ SF | Mon 8:15 PM | 16.4 | **FLEX GAME TIME STRATEGY** |
| **K** | Jason Myers | SEA | vs TEN | Sun 4:05 PM | 8.5 | Solid dome kicker |
| **D/ST** | **STREAM: Rams D/ST** | LAR | vs TB | Sun 8:25 PM | **5.7** | **+0.6 upgrade** |

**TOTAL PROJECTED: 118.3 points**

### Critical FLEX Game Time Strategy

**Tetairoa McMillan MUST be in the FLEX position** as he plays Monday Night Football (8:15 PM ET). This provides maximum lineup flexibility:

- **Sunday 1:00 PM games:** Monitor injury news for Love, Wilson, Singletary, Juwan Johnson
- **Sunday 4:05-4:25 PM games:** JSN, Rice provide afternoon injury insurance
- **Monday Night:** McMillan as final option allows you to pivot if Sunday players are ruled out

**Alternative FLEX options if McMillan sits:**
1. Jameson Williams (DET) - 12.9 proj, Sun 1:00 PM
2. Bucky Irving (TB) - 12.2 proj, Sun 8:25 PM (HIGH RISK - see injury section)
3. Tyjae Spears (TEN) - 9.6 proj, Sun 4:05 PM

---

## Position-by-Position Analysis

### Quarterback: Jordan Love (GB)
**Projection:** 17.4 | **Confidence:** HIGH

Love faces Minnesota in a divisional matchup at Lambeau. The Vikings defense has been vulnerable to passing attacks, and Love has shown consistency with JSN-level weapons. No concerns here - set and forget.

**Backup:** Aaron Rodgers (PIT) showing 0.0 projection, likely injury-related. Monitor but don't start.

### Running Backs: Critical Position Due to Injuries

**RB1 - Emanuel Wilson (GB): 14.5 proj**
- **Role:** Josh Jacobs replacement, established as starter
- **Matchup:** vs MIN (favorable volume matchup)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (role secure, production solid)

**RB2 - Devin Singletary (NYG): 8.0 proj**
- **Role:** Lead back, consistent volume
- **Matchup:** @ DET (Lions ranked #4 vs RB, tough road game)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM (low ceiling, solid PPR floor due to volume)

**BENCH - Bucky Irving (TB): 12.2 proj, 35% confidence, HIGH RISK**
- **Injury Update (Nov 19):** Participated in Wednesday walk-through practice in uniform, catching passes. Coach Todd Bowles says Irving is "ramping up" this week.
- **Injury History:** Missed 6 consecutive games with foot + shoulder injuries
- **Week 12 Outlook:** Thursday/Friday practice reports will determine availability. Even if active, snap count/effectiveness uncertain in first game back.
- **Recommendation:** **Keep benched**. Monitor practice reports Thu/Fri, but don't risk starting in a must-win game.

**Position Depth:** Concerning. If Wilson or Singletary get injured, we're down to Spears (9.6) or Allgeier (6.8). Consider waiver adds (see below).

### Wide Receivers: Strong Group With One Injury

**WR1 - Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA): 21.3 proj**
- Elite WR1 production, Tennessee's defense struggles vs slot receivers
- **Confidence:** VERY HIGH

**WR2 - Rashee Rice (KC): 17.7 proj**
- Patrick Mahomes' favorite target, PPR monster
- **Confidence:** HIGH

**FLEX - Tetairoa McMillan (CAR): 16.4 proj**
- Rookie WR with expanding role, Monday Night game provides lineup flexibility
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH

**BENCH - Jameson Williams (DET): 12.9 proj**
- Boom/bust deep threat, solid FLEX insurance if McMillan sits
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

**INJURED - Marvin Harrison Jr. (ARI): OUT Week 12**
- **Injury Update (Nov 19):** Officially ruled OUT for Week 12 (vs Jacksonville)
- **Surgery:** Appendectomy performed Nov 12, 2025
- **Timeline:** Typical recovery 2-3 weeks. Not placed on IR, so max 4 weeks.
- **Expected Return:** Week 13 (earliest) to Week 14 (more likely)
- **Recommendation:** **Hold on bench**. Week 14 return would be just in time for fantasy playoffs (Weeks 15-17).

### Tight End: Juwan Johnson (NO)
**Projection:** 9.2 | **Confidence:** MEDIUM

Johnson has carved out a consistent red zone role in New Orleans. The 9.2 projection is solid for TE streaming. Evan Engram (DEN) on bench showing 0.0 suggests bye or injury.

### Kicker: Jason Myers (SEA)
**Projection:** 8.5 | **Alternative:** Michael Badgley (8.3)

Myers is fine. No need to stream with 8.5 projection.

### Defense/Special Teams: **ACTION REQUIRED**

**Current:** Falcons D/ST (5.1 proj) vs NO
**Recommended Stream:** **Rams D/ST (5.7 proj) vs TB**
**Upgrade:** +0.6 points

**Why Rams D/ST:**
- **Recent Performance:** Picked off Sam Darnold 4 times last week, ranked 5th among defenses in fantasy points
- **Season Metrics:** 2nd in turnover rate, 5th in scoring rate, 5th in EPA per play allowed over last 2 months
- **Front Four:** Byron Young and Jared Verse leading a talented pass rush
- **Matchup:** Tampa Bay could have Bucky Irving/Chris Godwin returning (both questionable), but Rams' defense has been elite lately
- **Game Script:** Sunday Night Football, Rams favored at home

**Waiver Move:** Drop Falcons D/ST, add Rams D/ST

---

## Waiver Wire Recommendations

### Priority 1: STREAM DEFENSE
**Add:** Rams D/ST (LAR)
**Drop:** Falcons D/ST (ATL)
**Rationale:** +0.6 point upgrade, top-10 fantasy defense this week, strong recent form

### Priority 2: RB DEPTH (Optional)
**Available RBs:**
- Chuba Hubbard (CAR) - 4.8 proj, Rank #35
- Trey Benson (ARI) - 11.1 proj, Rank #58
- J.K. Dobbins (DEN) - 0.0 proj (likely IR/OUT)

**Analysis:** Hubbard and Benson show low projections and may not be worth rostering. Our RB depth (Wilson, Singletary, Irving, Spears, Allgeier) is actually solid if Irving returns. **SKIP** unless you want to drop Allgeier for Benson as a speculative add.

### Week 12 Bye Week Note
**Bye Teams:** Broncos, Chargers, Dolphins, Commanders

This explains why top free agent WRs show 0.0 projections:
- Keenan Allen (LAC) - ON BYE
- Terry McLaurin (WSH) - ON BYE

**Action:** Monitor these players for Week 13 if WR depth becomes an issue.

---

## Trade Strategy: 7 Days to Deadline

**Trade Deadline:** November 26, 2025 @ 11:00 AM CST (7 days remaining)

### Current Situation Assessment

**Team Strengths:**
- WR depth (JSN, Rice, McMillan, Williams, Harrison Jr. returning)
- Solid QB (Jordan Love)
- Decent RB duo if Irving returns (Wilson, Singletary, Irving)

**Team Weaknesses:**
- RB depth if Irving doesn't return (only Spears/Allgeier as backups)
- TE inconsistency (streaming Juwan Johnson)

### Trade Recommendation: **HOLD TIGHT**

**Rationale:**
1. **Projected to win this week** (+17.2 margin) - no need for panic moves
2. **RB situation improving** - Emanuel Wilson established as starter, Irving potentially returning
3. **7 days is tight** - trades require negotiation, league approval, processing time
4. **WR depth is strong** - Harrison Jr. returns Week 13-14, right for playoff push
5. **Risk vs Reward** - trading away depth before playoffs (Weeks 15-17) could backfire

### IF You Must Trade (Only if these conditions met):

**Scenario:** You want to upgrade TE or add RB1 insurance

**Trade Assets:**
- Jameson Williams (DET) - 12.9 proj, boom/bust WR3
- Tetairoa McMillan (CAR) - 16.4 proj, but you have JSN/Rice/Harrison
- Tyler Allgeier (ATL) - 6.8 proj, droppable handcuff

**Potential Targets:**
- Elite TE (Travis Kelce, George Kittle, Trey McBride) if you can package Williams + Allgeier
- RB1 upgrade if you can sell high on Wilson (but risky given your depth)

**Trade Principles:**
- Must be **OBVIOUSLY FAIR** for both teams
- Must upgrade starting lineup, not just shuffle bench pieces
- Prioritize playoff schedule (Weeks 15-17 matchups)

**Bottom Line:** Unless you have a specific trade offer in mind, **SKIP TRADES THIS WEEK** and focus on winning with your current roster. You're projected to win by 17 points - trust the lineup.

## Matchup Analysis: vs Wookie of the Year

**Opponent Record:** 6-5 (Rank #5)
**Their Projected Score:** 101.1
**Your Projected Score:** 118.3
**Projected Margin:** +17.2 (YOU WIN)

### Their Top Threats

| Position | Player | Team | Projection | Concern Level |
|----------|--------|------|------------|---------------|
| QB | Drake Maye | NE | 25.1 | **HIGH - Their best player** |
| WR | George Pickens | PIT | 16.6 | MEDIUM |
| RB | Chase Brown | CIN | 15.8 | MEDIUM |

**Analysis:**
- **Drake Maye (25.1 proj)** is their ceiling-raiser. If he has a massive game (30+ points), they could exceed projection.
- Their supporting cast is weaker (Pickens 16.6, Brown 15.8)
- Your top-3 scorers (JSN 21.3, Rice 17.7, Love 17.4) match up well against their best

### Win Conditions

**Your Path to Victory:**
1. **JSN and Rice perform to projection** - Combined 39 points from your WR1/WR2 is devastating in PPR
2. **Emanuel Wilson secures RB1 role** - 14.5 points gives you positional advantage
3. **Limit Drake Maye ceiling** - Hope for game script that doesn't require NE to air it out

**Their Path to Victory:**
1. Drake Maye goes nuclear (35+ points)
2. Your RBs underperform (Wilson/Singletary combine for <15 points)
3. Bucky Irving injury forces you to pivot to lower-floor bench options

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- You're favored by 17 points
- Your WR core is elite
- Their QB is dangerous but needs support players to also boom

**Bottom Line:** Win probability is FAVORABLE. Execute the gameplan, monitor injury reports, and you should move to 6-6.

## Season Outlook: Playoff Push

**Current Standing:** 5-6 (Rank #7 of 12)
**Playoff Cutoff:** Top 6 teams
**Games Remaining:** 3 (Weeks 12, 13, 14)

### Playoff Scenarios

**Week 12 WIN (move to 6-6):**
- Climb to Rank #5-6 range (depending on other results)
- **Playoff probability increases to ~40-50%**
- Need 1-2 wins in Weeks 13-14 to secure playoff spot

**Week 12 LOSS (stay at 5-7):**
- Drop to Rank #8-9 range
- **Playoff probability drops to ~10-15%**
- Would need to win out (Weeks 13-14) AND get help from other teams

### Critical Context

**This is a MUST-WIN game.**

- You're projected to win by 17 points (118.3 vs 101.1)
- Favorable matchup against opponent with elite QB but weak supporting cast
- RB situation stabilizing (Wilson, Singletary, potentially Irving)
- WR core is elite (JSN, Rice, McMillan)

**Key Dates:**
- **Week 12 (Nov 24):** THIS WEEK - must win
- **Trade Deadline (Nov 26):** 7 days away, but unlikely to make moves
- **Week 13 (Dec 1):** Marvin Harrison Jr. potential return, Bucky Irving should be healthy
- **Week 14 (Dec 8):** Final regular season game before playoffs
- **Weeks 15-17:** Fantasy playoffs (NFL Weeks 16-18)

### Marvin Harrison Jr. Return Impact

If Harrison returns Week 13 as expected:
- **Starting WRs:** JSN (21.3), Rice (17.7), Harrison (16-18 est.)
- **FLEX options:** McMillan (16.4), Williams (12.9)
- **This would give you a TOP-3 WR corps in the league**

Combined with healthy RBs (Wilson, Singletary, Irving), you'd be a legitimate playoff contender.

**Playoff Schedule (Weeks 15-17):**
- Need to research opponent matchups for playoff weeks
- Prioritize players with favorable playoff schedules in any waiver adds

---

## Summary: Critical Reminders

1. **WAIVER MOVE:** Drop Falcons D/ST, Add Rams D/ST (+0.6 pt upgrade)
2. **FLEX POSITIONING:** Tetairoa McMillan MUST be in FLEX (Mon 8:15 PM for max flexibility)
3. **INJURY MONITORS:** Bucky Irving (Thu/Fri practice reports), Marvin Harrison Jr. (Week 13 return target)
4. **TRADE DEADLINE:** 7 days away, but HOLD TIGHT unless obvious upgrade available
5. **MUST-WIN GAME:** 5-6 record, projected to WIN by 17 points, need this to stay in playoff hunt
6. **BYE WEEK AWARENESS:** Chargers/Commanders on bye (explains Allen/McLaurin 0.0 projections)

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Projected Outcome:** WIN by 17.2 points (118.3 vs 101.1)
**Playoff Probability After Win:** ~40-50%

**Let's get to 6-6 and keep the playoff dream alive!**

## APPENDIX: ESPN Projection Accuracy Analysis

### How Accurate Are ESPN Projections?

I analyzed all ESPN projections vs actual points for your roster across Weeks 1-11 (197 player-week records). Here's what the data reveals about projection reliability.

### Overall Accuracy Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | 4.79 pts | On average, ESPN is off by ~5 points per player |
| **Mean Error (Bias)** | -0.83 pts | ESPN slightly under-projects (players score 0.8 pts more than projected) |
| **R² Correlation** | 0.382 | Moderate correlation - projections have predictive value but significant variance |
| **Root Mean Square Error** | 6.52 pts | Typical prediction error range |

**Translation:** ESPN projections are moderately useful but expect 5-point swings regularly. Use projections as a starting point, not gospel.

---

### Accuracy By Position

| Position | R² | MAE | Bias | Sample Size | Predictability |
|----------|-----|-----|------|-------------|----------------|
| **RB** | 0.422 | 4.26 | -0.20 | 55 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ MOST predictable |
| **WR** | 0.354 | 5.36 | -0.75 | 78 | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderately predictable |
| **D/ST** | 0.332 | 4.15 | -1.50 | 12 | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderately predictable |
| **QB** | 0.250 | 6.52 | **-2.56** | 16 | ⭐⭐ UNDER-projected |
| **TE** | 0.173 | 3.90 | -1.00 | 24 | ⭐ Least predictable |
| **K** | 0.000 | 3.62 | -0.85 | 12 | Random noise |

---

### Key Insights for Lineup Decisions

**1. RBs Are Most Reliable**
- Highest R² (0.422) means ESPN projections are fairly accurate for RBs
- Lowest MAE (4.26 pts) = smallest average error
- **Trust RB projections** more than other positions when making start/sit calls

**2. QBs Are Consistently Under-Projected**
- Bias of -2.56 pts = QBs score 2.6 pts MORE than projected on average
- MAE of 6.52 pts = largest average error
- **Add 2-3 points mentally** when evaluating QB projections (Jordan Love 17.4 proj → expect ~20 pts)

**3. TEs and Kickers Are Unpredictable**
- TE R² = 0.173 (very weak correlation)
- Kicker R² = 0.000 (essentially random)
- **Don't overthink TE/K decisions** - projections are barely better than guessing

**4. Wide Receivers Show Moderate Reliability**
- R² = 0.354 (middle of the pack)
- MAE = 5.36 pts (larger variance than RBs)
- **Use with caution** - WR projections are directionally useful but can miss by 5+ points

---

### Notable Outliers from Your Roster

**Biggest Overperformances (Actual > Projected):**
1. Tetairoa McMillan Week 11: **+19.53 pts** (13.47 proj → 33.00 actual)
2. Cam Skattebo Week 6: **+17.15 pts** (13.85 proj → 31.00 actual)
3. Keenan Allen Week 7: **+15.38 pts** (13.52 proj → 28.90 actual)
4. Cam Skattebo Week 3: **+13.97 pts** (10.13 proj → 24.10 actual)
5. Jaxon Smith-Njigba Week 6: **+12.27 pts** (17.93 proj → 30.20 actual)

**Biggest Underperformances (Actual < Projected):**
1. Justin Fields Week 7: **-14.29 pts** (18.33 proj → 4.04 actual)
2. J.K. Dobbins Week 6: **-12.01 pts** (16.01 proj → 4.00 actual)
3. Seahawks D/ST Week 5: **-10.77 pts** (5.77 proj → -5.00 actual)
4. Darnell Mooney Week 8: **-10.14 pts** (12.24 proj → 2.10 actual)
5. Aaron Rodgers Week 11: **-9.47 pts** (18.91 proj → 9.44 actual)

**Pattern:** Cam Skattebo and JSN consistently beat projections. J.K. Dobbins and Keenan Allen show high variance.

---

### Weekly Accuracy Trends

**Does ESPN Get Better Over Time?**

| Week | MAE | Bias | Observation |
|------|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | 4.22 | -0.41 | Good early accuracy |
| 2 | 5.09 | +0.97 | Slight over-projection |
| 3 | 4.39 | -0.41 | Return to under-projection |
| 4 | 3.89 | +0.20 | **Best accuracy week** |
| 5 | 3.57 | +0.91 | **Best overall week** |
| 6 | 5.62 | +0.29 | Accuracy deteriorates |
| 7 | 5.12 | +0.21 | Still below average |
| 8 | 4.46 | +0.54 | Moderate |
| 9 | 3.50 | -1.66 | Good accuracy, under-projects |
| 10 | 3.55 | -1.39 | Good accuracy, under-projects |
| 11 | 4.58 | +0.68 | Moderate |

**Finding:** Accuracy does NOT consistently improve over the season. Weeks 4-5 and 9-10 had best accuracy. Week 6-7 had worst accuracy.

---

### Practical Applications for Week 12

**1. Trust RB Projections More Than Others**
- Emanuel Wilson (14.5 proj) → **Likely accurate** (RB R² = 0.422)
- Devin Singletary (8.0 proj) → **Trust the floor**

**2. Add 2-3 Points to QB Projections**
- Jordan Love (17.4 proj) → **Expect 19-20 pts** (QB bias = -2.56)

**3. Don't Overthink TE Decisions**
- Juwan Johnson (9.2 proj) → **Could be 5-15 pts** (TE R² = 0.173)
- TE projections are barely better than coin flips

**4. WR Projections Have 5+ Point Variance**
- JSN (21.3 proj) → **Range: 16-26 pts** (MAE = 5.36)
- Rice (17.7 proj) → **Range: 12-23 pts**
- McMillan (16.4 proj) → **Could boom like Week 11** (+19.53 outlier)

**5. Kicker Projections Are Meaningless**
- Jason Myers (8.5 proj) → **Ignore, just pick dome game or high O/U**

---

### Bottom Line

ESPN projections are **moderately useful but not infallible**:
- ✅ **Trust RB projections** (most accurate)
- ⚠️ **Add 2-3 pts to QB projections** (consistently under-projected)
- ❌ **Don't rely on TE/K projections** (essentially random)
- ⚠️ **WR projections are directional** (±5 pt variance)

When making tough start/sit decisions, use ESPN projections as ONE input, but factor in:
- Matchup quality (opponent defensive rank)
- Recent performance trends (hot/cold streaks)
- Game script expectations (Vegas O/U, spread)
- Injury/weather concerns

**The data shows: Trust your gut + matchup analysis over blind projection following.**
