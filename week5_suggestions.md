## üìä Position-by-Position Analysis

### QUARTERBACK

#### **MUST STREAM THIS WEEK - Jordan Love on BYE**

**Streaming Option: Tua Tagovailoa (MIA)**
- **Projection:** 15.5 points vs Carolina
- **Availability:** CONFIRMED on free agents list
- **Analysis:** Tua faces the 12th-ranked passing defense (198.3 yards/game). Carolina allows the least pressure in NFL (25.4% rate) and lowest sack rate (1.7%), giving Tua clean pockets. Has multiple passing TDs in last three games.
- **Concern:** With Tyreek Hill out for season, offense may struggle. No QB has thrown for 300+ yards vs CAR in 2025.
- **Verdict:** Low-end QB2 - usable in emergency but limited upside

**Alternative Streaming Options:**
- **Joe Burrow (CIN)** - Also available per free agents list (0.0 proj shown but viable backup)
- **Note:** Both Burrow and Tua confirmed available on your free agents list

---

### RUNNING BACKS

#### **RB1: Cam Skattebo (NYG)**
- **Projection:** 17.1 points @ New Orleans
- **Analysis:** ELITE VOLUME - Skattebo is the unquestioned RB1 with Tyrone Tracy sidelined. Has scored 13+ fantasy points in each of last three games, with 24-point explosion in Week 3. Since Week 2, ranks 3rd in NFL in red-zone carries among RBs.
- **Matchup:** Saints rank in top-12 in rush yards allowed, presenting moderate difficulty. However, Skattebo's dual-threat ability (caught both targets for 11 yards Week 4) provides PPR safety.
- **Week 4 Performance:** 79 rush yards on 25 carries, 2 receptions for 11 yards vs Chargers
- **Usage:** Giants feed him carries when leading, pepper him with targets when trailing
- **Verdict:** MUST START - Volume is king in fantasy, and Skattebo has elite opportunity

#### **RB2: J.K. Dobbins (DEN)**
- **Projection:** 12.2 points @ Philadelphia
- **Analysis:** Road matchup at Eagles presents challenges, but Dobbins maintains 71% snap share as clear RB1. Averaging 5.4 YPC through first four weeks. Denver's offensive line ranks 2nd in league.
- **Matchup:** Eagles defense allows pressure at moderate rates. Game script could be challenging as road underdog.
- **Verdict:** START - Volume and talent justify RB2 slot despite tough matchup

#### **BENCH: Bucky Irving (TB) - QUESTIONABLE**
- **Injury Status:** Sprained foot suffered in Week 4 vs Eagles. In walking boot, did not practice Wednesday.
- **Coach's Quote:** Todd Bowles - "If he's not out of the boot by Friday, I'll be more inclined to say he's probably not going to play."
- **Timeline:** Week-to-week injury, not feared to be long-term
- **Action Plan:** Monitor practice reports Thursday/Friday. If Irving is ruled out, Skattebo's workload becomes even more valuable.
- **Verdict:** DO NOT START - Too risky with game-time decision tag

---

### WIDE RECEIVERS

#### **WR1: Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA)**
- **Projection:** 15.9 points vs Tampa Bay
- **Analysis:** ELITE WR1 STATUS - JSN ranks as ESPN's overall WR7 for Week 5. Caught 4-of-5 targets for 79 yards in Week 4 Thursday night win vs Cardinals, including critical 22-yard reception to set up game-winning FG.
- **Matchup:** Buccaneers missing Mike Evans and two starting offensive linemen, suggesting positive game script for Seattle pass attack.
- **Season Context:** Has established himself as bonafide fantasy WR1 despite limited overall passing volume from Seattle offense.
- **Seahawks Offensive:** Home game advantage at Lumen Field
- **Verdict:** MUST START - Safe WR1 floor with WR1 ceiling every week

#### **WR2: Keenan Allen (LAC)**
- **Projection:** 14.6 points @ Washington
- **Analysis:** At age 33, Allen remains Herbert's red-zone favorite. Washington defense ranks bottom-10 in pass defense, presenting favorable matchup. This could be peak trade value after strong early-season performances.
- **Target Share:** Consistent veteran presence in high-powered Chargers offense
- **Road Concern:** Away game but against weak secondary
- **Verdict:** START - Favorable matchup outweighs age concerns

#### **FLEX: Tetairoa McMillan (CAR)**
- **Projection:** 14.1 points @ Miami
- **Analysis:** Carolina's unquestioned WR1 with elite 34% target share. Bryce Young has shown improvement, and McMillan's volume is matchup-proof. Dolphins defense ranks 9th vs WRs (moderate difficulty), but garbage time opportunities exist as road underdog.
- **Target Volume:** No competition for targets in Carolina offense
- **Concern:** Tough matchup vs MIA ranked #9 defense vs WRs
- **Verdict:** START - Volume justifies flex spot, TD regression coming

#### **Key Bench WRs:**

**Marvin Harrison Jr. (ARI) - BENCH THIS WEEK**
- On bye with Cardinals (Week 5 byes: GB, CHI, ATL, PIT)
- Actually, wait - let me verify: Cardinals NOT on bye
- **Correction:** MHJ is available to play but benched for better matchups
- Elite talent but inconsistent target share early in season
- **Hold:** Prime buy-low candidate, don't drop

**Hollywood Brown (KC) - BENCH**
- Limited role behind Mahomes' weapons (Kelce, Xavier Worthy)
- Trade value exceeds production
- **Action:** Shop in trade packages for WR upgrade

**Matthew Golden (GB) - BYE WEEK**
- Packers on bye Week 5
- Deep bench stash only

**Darnell Mooney (ATL) - BYE WEEK**
- Falcons on bye Week 5
- Emerged as WR2 behind Drake London
- **Action:** Start next week when bye ends

**Rashee Rice (KC) - SUSPENDED**
- Suspended through Week 6 for violating personal conduct policy
- Eligible for reinstatement Oct 13 following Week 6 game
- Returns Week 7 vs Las Vegas Raiders
- **CRITICAL:** DO NOT DROP - Will be immediate WR2/Flex upon return

---

### TIGHT END

#### **STARTER: Cade Otton (TB)**
- **Projection:** 7.7 points (estimated, same as Engram shown)
- **Analysis:** Established role in Tampa offense. With Mike Evans injured/out, Otton could see increased targets. Road game at Seattle presents moderate difficulty.
- **Alternative:** Evan Engram on bench with 7.7 projection
- **Decision Point:** Both TEs projected identically - Otton gets slight edge as Tampa's clear TE1
- **Verdict:** START OTTON - Safer floor than streaming alternatives

---

### KICKER

#### **STARTER: Jake Elliott (PHI)**
- **Projection:** 8.1 points vs Denver
- **Analysis:** Eagles' high-powered offense provides consistent opportunities. Home game vs Denver. Set-and-forget kicker.
- **Alternative Available:** Harrison Butker (KC) - 7.7 proj on free agents list
- **Verdict:** STICK WITH ELLIOTT - Slightly higher projection, no need to churn

---

### DEFENSE/SPECIAL TEAMS

#### **RECOMMENDED: Seahawks D/ST (STREAM)**
- **Projection:** 5.9 points vs Tampa Bay
- **Availability:** CONFIRMED #1 D/ST on free agents list
- **Analysis:** ELITE STREAMING PLAY
  - Ranks 4th overall in D/ST scoring (12.2 fantasy points/game)
  - Ranks 3rd in opponents' scoring rate, 4th in conversion rate, 6th in turnover rate
  - Three consecutive weeks of double-digit fantasy points
  - Week 4: 6 sacks, 2 INTs vs Arizona
  - Has recorded 2 INTs vs 49ers, Steelers, AND Cardinals (elite ball-hawking)
- **Matchup:** Buccaneers WITHOUT Mike Evans and TWO starting offensive linemen
- **Ownership:** 57% rostered - still available in your league
- **Verdict:** MUST ADD - Top streaming defense for Week 5

#### **CURRENT: Texans D/ST (DROP)**
- **Projection:** 5.5 points
- **Action:** Drop Texans to add Seahawks D/ST
- **Rationale:** Seahawks have higher projection and better matchup

**Other Top Week 5 D/ST Streaming Options:**
- **Vikings D/ST** @ Browns (London game, 9:30 AM ET) - Must-start matchup
- **Cardinals D/ST** vs Titans - Titans worst offense in NFL (12.8 pts/game, 17 sacks allowed)
- **Ravens D/ST** - Available (4.1 proj per your free agents list)

1. **Texans D/ST** - Replace with Seahawks D/ST (confirmed available)
2. **Matthew Golden (WR)** - Deep bench piece on BYE, lowest upside

---

## üí∞ Trade Strategy for Week 5

### YOUR TRADE ASSETS (Sell High)

**1. Keenan Allen (WR, LAC)**
- Age 33, peak trade value NOW after strong start
- Name recognition exceeds long-term value
- Target: Package for younger WR1
- **Offer Example:** Allen + Hollywood Brown for elite WR (Davante Adams, Mike Evans type)

**2. Hollywood Brown (WR, KC)**
- Limited role in KC offense (behind Kelce, Worthy, Rice when returns)
- Name value exceeds production
- **Use:** Package deal filler for WR upgrade

**3. Cam Skattebo (RB, NYG)**
- After strong Week 5, value may spike
- Rookie with unclear long-term role
- **Consider:** Sell high if Week 5 performance is elite (20+ points)

---

### BUY-LOW TARGETS (via trade from other teams)

**Players YOU Already Own - HOLD, Don't Trade For:**
- **Tetairoa McMillan** - Already on your roster! 34% target share is elite
- **Marvin Harrison Jr.** - Already on your roster! Prime buy-low moment passed

**External Trade Targets:**
1. **Chris Olave (WR, NO)** - Huge upside, currently depressed value
2. **Chase Brown (RB, CIN)** - Value cratered, buy for depth
3. **Terry McLaurin (WR, WAS)** - Target share jumping
4. **A.J. Brown (WR, PHI)** - Elite talent at potential discount

**Trade Package Suggestion:**
- **GIVE:** Keenan Allen + Hollywood Brown
- **GET:** Chris Olave OR A.J. Brown (single elite WR1)
- **Rationale:** Consolidate aging assets for 25-year-old upside

---

### PLAYERS TO TARGET FROM WAIVERS (Not Trades)

Remember: Only add players from YOUR free agents list or verify availability first!
- Seahawks D/ST (confirmed available)
- Tua Tagovailoa (confirmed available)
